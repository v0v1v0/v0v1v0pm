<h2>MAGMA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function conducts many group matching for 2 to 4 groups. It augments
the original data set by the relevant 'MAGMA.R' variables. For details, see
below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">MAGMA(Data, group, dist, cores = 1, verbose = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame or tibble containing at least your grouping and
distance variable. Data needs to be specified in your environment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character specifying the name of
your grouping variable in the data. Note that MAGMA can only match your data
for a maximum of 4 groups. Matching over two grouping variables (e.g., 2x2
Design) is possible by specifying group as a character vector with a length
of two. In this case, each or the 2 grouping variables can only have two
levels.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character specifying the name of your distance
variable in data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer defining the number of cores used for
parallel computation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE or FALSE indicating whether matching information should
be printed to the console.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function conducts nearest neighbor many group matching. It is
applicable for two to four groups or a 2x2 design. As output, this function
augments your original data by the variables <em>weight</em>, <em>step</em>, <em>distance</em>,
and <em>ID</em>. Weight indicates whether a case was matched. Step specifies the
iteration in which a case was matched. It also shows which cases were matched
together. Distance indicates the mean difference within a match. Since
matches with a lower distance are matched in an earlier iteration, step and
distance are strongly correlated.
This function has some CPU and RAM load. In most four-group applications and
three-group applications with large sample size, RAM may be not sufficient.
Therefore MAGMA switches to random quasi-systematic matching. If this is the
case, MAGMA informs you. The output of the function does not change, but
balance might be slightly affected.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Your input data frame augmented with matching
relevant variables, namely <em>weight</em>, <em>step</em>, <em>distance</em>, and <em>ID</em>. In case
of missing values on the distance or group variable, MAGMA excludes them for
the matching process. The returned data set does not contain those excluded
cases. For more information, see Details.
