<h2>Density_overlap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function shows and quantifies the kernel density overlap of a variable
for two or more groups.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Density_overlap(
  Data,
  variable,
  group,
  variable_name = NULL,
  group_labels = NULL,
  group_name = NULL,
  step_num = NULL,
  step_var = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame that contains the desired variable for density
plotting as well as the specified grouping variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>variable</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character specifying the variable for which the density
should be plotted (e.g., "ps_gifted").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character specifying the groups for which the density should
be plotted. Can be an independent group comparison (e.g., comparing matched
groups) or the comparison of pre and post matched samples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>variable_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character specifying the name to appear
in the plot for the variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group_labels</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector specifying the labels for the groups
to ppear in the legend of the plot.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character specifying the name of the grouping variable
to appear in the title of the legend.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>step_num</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer specifying the number of cases to be included
per group in this post matching comparison. Is based on the step variable of
MAGMA.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>step_var</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character specifying the name of the step variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE or FALSE indicating whether matching information should
be printed to the console.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function enables the comparison of the density of variables for two
or more groups. It plots the kernel density separately for each group and
quantifies the amount of overlap.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A plot showing the kernel density for a specified variable separately
for specified groups and the quantification of this overlap.
</p>
