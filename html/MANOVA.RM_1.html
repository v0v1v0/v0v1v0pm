<h2>MANOVA.RM: A package for calculating test statistics and their resampling versions for
heteroscedastic semi-parametric multivariate data or repeated measures designs.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The MANOVA.RM package provides three important functions: MANOVA(), RM() and multRM() which 
will be explained in detail below.
</p>


<h3>MANOVA and MANOVA.wide function</h3>

<p>The MANOVA() and MANOVA.wide() functions provide
the Wald-type statistic (WTS) as well as a modified ANOVA-type statistic (MATS)
as in Friedrich and Pauly (2018)
for multivariate designs with metric data as described in 
Konietschke et al. (2015). These are applicable
for non-normal error terms, different sample sizes and/or
heteroscedastic variances. The MATS can even handle designs involving singular
covariance matrices. The tests are implemented for designs with an arbitrary
number of crossed factors or for nested designs. In addition to the
asymptotic p-values, they also provide p-values based on resampling
approaches (parametric or wild bootstrap). The difference between the two functions
is the format of the data: For MANOVA(), the data needs to be in long format,
while MANOVA.wide() is for data in wide format.
For further details, see <code>MANOVA</code> and <code>MANOVA.wide</code>.
</p>


<h3>RM function</h3>

<p>The RM() function provides the Wald-type
statistic (WTS) as well as the ANOVA-type statistic (ATS) for repeated measures designs
with metric data as described in Friedrich et al. (2017).
These are even applicable for non-normal error terms and/or heteroscedastic
variances. It is implemented for designs with an arbitrary number of
whole-plot and sub-plot factors and allows for different sample sizes. In
addition to the asymptotic p-values, it also provides p-values based on
resampling approaches (Permutation, parametric bootstrap, Wild bootstrap).
For further details, see <code>RM</code>.
</p>


<h3>multRM function</h3>

<p>The multRM() function is a combination of the procedures
above suited for multivariate repeated measures designs. It provides the WTS and the MATS
along with p-values based on a parametric or a wild bootstrap approach.
