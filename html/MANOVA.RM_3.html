<h2>EEG Measurements in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease (long format)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>At the Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Salzburg, 160 patients were diagnosed
with either AD, MCI, or SCC, based on neuropsychological diagnostics. This data set contains z-scores for brain rate and Hjorth complexity,
each measured at frontal, temporal and central electrode positions and averaged across hemispheres. In addition to standardization, complexity
values were multiplied by -1 in order to make them more easily comparable to brain rate
values: For brain rate we know that the values decrease with age and pathology, while
Hjorth complexity values are known to increase with age and pathology.
The three between-subjects factors considered were sex (men vs. women), diagnosis (AD
vs. MCI vs. SCC), and age (<code class="reqn">&lt; 70</code> vs. <code class="reqn">&gt;= 70</code> years). Additionally, the within-subjects factors region (frontal, temporal, central) and 
feature (brain rate, complexity) structure the response vector.
