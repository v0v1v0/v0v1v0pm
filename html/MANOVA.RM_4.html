<h2>EEG Measurements in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease (wide format)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>At the Department of Neurology, University Clinic of Salzburg, 160 patients were diagnosed
with either AD, MCI, or SCC, based on neuropsychological diagnostics. This data set contains z-scores for brain rate and Hjorth complexity,
each measured at frontal, temporal and central electrode positions and averaged across hemispheres. In addition to standardization, complexity
values were multiplied by -1 in order to make them more easily comparable to brain rate
values: For brain rate we know that the values decrease with age and pathology, while
Hjorth complexity values are known to increase with age and pathology.
The three between-subjects factors considered were sex (men vs. women), diagnosis (AD
vs. MCI vs. SCC), and age (<code class="reqn">&lt; 70</code> vs. <code class="reqn">&gt;= 70</code> years). Additionally, the within-subjects factors region (frontal, temporal, central) and 
feature (brain rate, complexity) structure the response vector.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that this data set contains exactly the same data as the data set 'EEG', only the format is different. The 
transformation between the different formats can be achieved using, e.g., the <code>tidyr</code> package.
