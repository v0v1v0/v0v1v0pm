<h2>MARMoT balancing method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Matching on poset-based average rank for multiple treatments (MARMoT).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">MARMoT(
  data,
  confounders,
  treatment,
  reference = "median",
  n.cores = 1,
  caliper = 0.25,
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataframe or equivalent.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>confounders</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing the column names of the confounders to balance by.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatment</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string indicating the column name of the treatment variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference</code></td>
<td>
<p>The statistic used to determine the reference frequencies in the balancing
process. Default is median.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of cores to be used (Linux and Mac systems only!); if a
number grater than 1 is specified the function will use a parallelized
version of the deloof approximation. Default set to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>caliper</code></td>
<td>
<p>Fraction of the standard deviation used to determine the closest neighbour.
Default is 0.25.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Set to FALSE to suppress any console output. Default is TRUE</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are many scenarios where classic propensity score techniques are not
applicable (e.g. there are many treatments). In a multiple-treatment
framework, MARMoT is a method to balance the distribution of covariates among
several treatment groups. MARMoT introduces a method for achieving balance
among treatment groups by utilizing partially ordered set (poset) theory.
This approach focuses on equalizing individual characteristics without
relying on propensity score techniques or a dependent variable. Unlike
propensity score methods, poset theory doesn't require assumptions about
model specifications for treatment allocation. Each subject is represented by
a profile of their characteristics, and an average rank approximation is
associated with each profile. This value represents the significance of
individual characteristics for treatment allocation and can be normalized for
better interpretability.
