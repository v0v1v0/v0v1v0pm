<h2>Subset of simulated psychotherapy treatment studies (k=8) with dependent effect sizes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set includes effect sizes for treatment vs control groups for a random subset of 8   simulated psychotherapy treatment studies (total population k = 1000). The known population standardized mean difference for outcome one is g = 0.50 and for outcome two g = 0.80. The data set also includes two correlated study-level variables (i.e., moderators): treatment duration (<code>dose</code>) and average participant distress (<code>stress</code>).
