<h2>Subset of simulated psychotherapy treatment studies (k=8) with means and SD</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set includes means and standard deviations for treatment and control groups for a subset of k = 8 simulated psychotherapy treatment studies from a population of k = 1000 (see dat.sim1 and dat.sim2 for the k = 1000 studies for outcome 1 and 2, respectfully). Although effect sizes are not calculated in this dataset, the known population standardized mean difference for outcome one is d=0.50 and for outcome two g=0.80. The data set also includes two correlated study-level variables (i.e., moderators): treatment duration (<code>dose</code>) and average participant distress (<code>stress</code>).
