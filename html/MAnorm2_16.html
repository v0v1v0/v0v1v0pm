<h2>Extend the Application Scope of a Mean-Variance Curve</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>extendMeanVarCurve</code> associates the mean-variance curve of a
<code>bioCond</code> object with a set of other <code>bioCond</code>s.
This function is called most often when ChIP-seq samples stored in some
<code>bioCond</code>s have a low data regularity (due to, for example, a bad data
quality), and you don't want to include them for fitting a
mean-variance curve (see "Examples" below and also
<code>fitMeanVarCurve</code>).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">extendMeanVarCurve(
  conds,
  base.cond,
  occupy.only = TRUE,
  no.rep.rv = NULL,
  invariant = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conds</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of <code>bioCond</code> objects.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>base.cond</code></td>
<td>
<p>An extra <code>bioCond</code> object, from which the
mean-variance curve is obtained.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>occupy.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical scalar. If it is <code>TRUE</code> (default), only
occupied intervals are used to estimate variance ratio factors (see also
"Details"). Otherwise, all intervals are used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>no.rep.rv</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive real specifying the variance ratio factor of
no-replicate conditions, if any. By default, it's set to be the
variance ratio factor of <code>base.cond</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>invariant</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional non-negative real specifying the upper bound
of difference in mean signal intensity
for a genomic interval to be treated
as invariant between two conditions.
By default, intervals occupied by both
conditions are treated as invariant between them. Note that this
argument is only used when the number of prior degrees of freedom of
<code>base.cond</code> is 0 (see also "Details").</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Technically, <code>extendMeanVarCurve</code> associates the mean-variance curve of
<code>base.cond</code> as well as its number of prior degrees of freedom to each
<code>bioCond</code> object in <code>conds</code>. Then, for each <code>bioCond</code>
in <code>conds</code>, its variance ratio factor is estimated accordingly (see
<code>estimatePriorDf</code> for details). Note that, if the inherited
number of prior degrees of freedom is 0, the regular routine for estimating
variance ratio factors does not apply.
In this case, <code>extendMeanVarCurve</code>
utilizes an alternative strategy to estimate the variance ratio factor of
each <code>bioCond</code> via comparing it with the <code>base.cond</code> (see
<code>varRatio</code> for details).
</p>
<p>As mentioned, the prior df of each <code>bioCond</code> in
<code>conds</code> is inherited from <code>base.cond</code>. Now that there are
new <code>bioCond</code> objects that are associated with the same mean-variance
curve as is <code>base.cond</code>, you may want to re-assess its goodness of fit
incorporating these new datasets. See "Examples" below for using
<code>estimatePriorDf</code> to re-estimate the number of
prior degrees of freedom.
</p>
<p>Another scenario where <code>extendMeanVarCurve</code> could be useful is when
each of two <code>bioCond</code> objects to be compared has only one ChIP-seq
sample. To make it possible to estimate the variances of individual genomic
intervals, a simple solution is to treat the two samples as if they were
replicates. Thus, a mean-variance curve can be fitted accordingly and then
be associated with the two <code>bioCond</code> objects. See "Examples"
for a complete routine for
calling differential intervals between two conditions
with no replicate samples at all. Notably, this method is most suited when
the two conditions being compared are close. Otherwise, the method may lead
to an over-conserved <em>p</em>-value calculation.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>extendMeanVarCurve</code> returns the argument list of
<code>bioCond</code> objects, each of which has an added (updated)
<code>fit.info</code> field constructed based on the mean-variance curve
associated with <code>base.cond</code>.
</p>
<p>Specifically, each returned <code>bioCond</code> inherits all the components
of its <code>fit.info</code> field from <code>base.cond</code> except the
<code>calls</code> and <code>ratio.var</code> (see <code>fitMeanVarCurve</code>
for a detailed description of the structure of a <code>fit.info</code> field).
All the returned <code>bioCond</code>s will have a record of this function
call, and their variance ratio factors are
separately estimated.
</p>
<p>Besides, an attribute named <code>"no.rep.rv"</code> will be added to the
returned list if it's ever been used as the variance ratio factor
of the <code>bioCond</code>s without replicate samples.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>You must normalize the <code>bioCond</code> objects in <code>conds</code>
together with the <code>base.cond</code> to the same level before invoking
this extension process. See
<code>normalize</code> and <code>normBioCond</code> for performing
MA normalization on ChIP-seq samples and <code>bioCond</code> objects,
respectively.
