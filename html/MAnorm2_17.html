<h2>Fit a Mean-Variance Curve</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a set of <code>bioCond</code> objects, <code>fitMeanVarCurve</code>
robustly fits a curve capturing the mean-variance dependence across
the genomic intervals contained in them, by iteratively detecting outliers
and removing them from a regression procedure.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function performs a regression of the variance of ChIP-seq signal
intensity across replicate samples, using the mean intensity as the only
predictor. Each genomic interval contained in each of the supplied
<code>bioCond</code>s that consists of two or more ChIP-seq samples serves
as an observation for the regression (the sample mean and sample variance of
the interval's signal intensities in the <code>bioCond</code> are used as the
predictor value and response, respectively).
</p>
<p>Note that <code>bioCond</code> objects must be normalized to the same level before
a mean-variance curve could be fitted for them. You can choose to either
normalize the involved ChIP-seq samples all together (see
<code>normalize</code>) or perform the normalization at the level of
<code>bioCond</code> objects (see <code>normBioCond</code> and also "Examples"
below).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>fitMeanVarCurve</code> returns the argument list of
<code>bioCond</code> objects, each of which has an added (updated)
<code>fit.info</code> field describing its mean-variance dependence. The field
is itself a list consisting of the following components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>calls</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The two function calls for associating a mean
variance curve with this <code>bioCond</code> and estimating the related
parameters, respectively. The latter is only present if you have
made an explicit call to some function (e.g.,
<code>estimatePriorDf</code>) for performing the parameter
estimation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>method</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Method used for fitting the mean-variance
curve.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>predict</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A function representing the fitted curve,
which accepts a vector of means and returns the predicted
variances.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mvcID</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>ID of the fitted mean-variance curve.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>df.prior</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of prior degrees of freedom
assessing the goodness of fit of the mean-variance curve.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ratio.var</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Variance ratio factor of this
<code>bioCond</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each <code>bioCond</code> object in the returned list has the same values of
all these components but the <code>ratio.var</code>.
</p>
<p><code>mvcID</code> is used to label each fitted mean-variance curve. Each
call to <code>fitMeanVarCurve</code> results in a unique ID. Thus we assert
that different <code>bioCond</code> objects are associated with the same
mean-variance curve if and only if they have the same <code>mvcID</code>. This
is useful if you are to
call differential intervals between two conditions
via <code>diffTest</code>, which requires the two
<code>bioCond</code> objects being compared are associated with the same
mean-variance curve.
</p>
<p>Besides, if there exist <code>bioCond</code> objects that contain only one
ChIP-seq sample, an attribute named <code>"no.rep.rv"</code> will be added to
the returned list, recording the variance ratio factor of no-replicate
conditions. Note that the method for estimating the variance ratio
factor of no-replicate conditions is specifically designed (see
<code>estimatePriorDf</code> for details).
</p>


<h3>Variance Ratio Factor</h3>

<p><code>fitMeanVarCurve</code> applies a regression
process to the observed means and variances of signal intensities of
genomic intervals. The regression result serves as a model capturing the
mean-variance trend across intervals.
Notably, each genomic interval in each
<code>bioCond</code> object that contains replicate samples serves as
an observation point for the regression.
</p>
<p>Variance ratio factor is designed to account for the global difference
in variation level of signal intensities between conditions. Each
<code>bioCond</code> has its own variance ratio factor, and method has been
developed to robustly estimate the relative (scaled) variance ratio
factors of a given set of <code>bioCond</code>s
(see <code>estimateVarRatio</code> for details).
Technically, observed variances from each <code>bioCond</code> are
scaled based on the corresponding (relative) variance ratio factor, so
that the scaled variances from different <code>bioCond</code>s are comparable
to each other. Finally, the scaled variances from all the provided
<code>bioCond</code>s are pooled together constituting the vector of responses
for the regression process. Note that the variance ratio factors will be
adjusted afterwards, according to the fitted mean-variance curve and its
goodness of fit (see "Assessing Goodness of Fit" below).
</p>


<h3>Methods for Fitting a Mean-Variance Curve</h3>

<p>There are currently two
candidate methods for performing the regression:
<code>"parametric fit"</code> (default) and <code>"local regression"</code>.
Besides, the argument <code>occupy.only</code> controls whether to use all
genomic intervals or only the occupied ones for the regression process.
</p>
<p>Typically, ChIP-seq signal intensities at
non-occupied intervals are much
lower than those at occupied ones. Accordingly, variation levels of the
former are significantly higher than the latter (provided that a log
transformation has been applied to raw read counts before performing
the normalization, which is the default setting of
<code>normalize</code>). This is because,
for the genomic intervals having
a low-level abundance of ChIP-seq reads, only a little fluctuation of
read count could give rise to a dramatic fold change. If a mean-variance
scatter plot is drawn mapping all genomic intervals to a plane, the
points corresponding to non-occupied intervals will be largely separated
from those of occupied intervals.
</p>
<p>In practice, the ChIP-seq signals located in
non-occupied intervals result
primarily from background noise and therefore have much lower
signal-to-noise ratios than those in occupied intervals. As a result,
signals observed in the two types of intervals
almost always have distinct
data characteristics from one another. In particular, the mean-variance
dependence associated with non-occupied intervals is not as regular as
observed from occupied intervals. In light of these observations, the
recommended setting of <code>occupy.only</code> may be different across calls
of <code>fitMeanVarCurve</code> depending on the exact <code>method</code> chosen
for performing the regression. See the following for details.
</p>
<p>For the method of <code>"parametric fit"</code>, it adopts the parametric form
of <code class="reqn">var = c1 + c2 / (2 ^ mean)</code>, where <code class="reqn">c1</code> and <code class="reqn">c2</code> are
coefficients to be estimated. More specifically, it fits a gamma-family
generalized linear model with the identity link. The form is
deduced by assuming a quadratic mean-variance relationship for raw read
counts and applying the delta method to log2 transformation (see also
"References"). When using this method, one typically sets
<code>occupy.only</code> to <code>TRUE</code> (the default). Otherwise, the
GLM fitting procedure may fail to estimate the coefficients, or the
estimation results may be significantly biased towards the
characteristics of ChIP-seq signals at non-occupied intervals (which is
undesired since these signals are mostly background noises). Note also
that applying this method is most recommended when ChIP-seq samples
within each single <code>bioCond</code> are associated with a low level
of signal variation (e.g., when these samples are biological replicates
of a cell line; see also "Examples" below),
since in such cases ChIP-seq data should be of high regularity
and, thus, the parametric form could be safely expected to hold.
Moreover, as the variation level across ChIP-seq samples increases,
the possibility becomes higher that the GLM fitting procedure fails.
</p>
<p>For the method of <code>"local regression"</code>, it directly passes the
observed means and scaled variances to the <code>locfit</code>
function, specifying the <code>family</code> to be <code>"gamma"</code>. When using
this method, setting <code>occupy.only</code> to <code>TRUE</code> almost certainly
leads to an exaggerated variance prediction for small signal intensities
(due to the underlying algorithm for extrapolation)
and, thus, a reduction in statistical power for detecting differential
intervals between conditions. On the other hand,
involving non-occupied intervals
in the fitting process might result in an underestimated number of prior
degrees of freedom (see "Assessing Goodness of Fit" below). This is
because the ChIP-seq signals located in non-occupied intervals generally
have low signal-to-noise ratios, and are therefore associated with less
data regularity than the signals in occupied intervals. One way to
compensate that is to re-estimate the prior df using
only the occupied intervals after fitting the mean-variance curve (see
<code>estimatePriorDf</code> and "Examples" below), which is also the
most recommended strategy for employing a local regression. Note also
that smoothness of the resulting curve could be adjusted by modifying
the <code>nn</code> variable in <code>args.lp</code> (see also
<code>lp</code>). By default, <code>nn=0.7</code> is adopted, which
is also the default setting of <code>lp</code> at the time of
developing this package.
</p>


<h3>Iteration Scheme for a Robust Regression</h3>

<p>Whichever method is
selected, <code>fitMeanVarCurve</code> adopts an iteration scheme to enhance
the robustness of fitting the mean-variance trend. More specifically,
it iteratively detects and removes outliers from a regression procedure.
The process converges as soon as the set of outliers fixes.
Residual of each observation is calculated as the ratio of its observed
variance to the fitted one, and those observations with a residual
falling outside <code>range.residual</code> shall be considered as outliers.
The default value of <code>range.residual</code> works well for chi-squared
distributions with a broad range of numbers of degrees of freedom (see
also "References").
</p>


<h3>Assessing Goodness of Fit</h3>

<p>Each fitted mean-variance curve is
associated with a quantity assessing its goodness of fit, which is the
number of prior degrees of freedom. Roughly speaking, the closer the
observed mean-variance points are to the curve, the larger the resulting
prior df of the curve, and we get more confidence in the curve.
To be noted, the initial variance ratio factors for scaling the sample
variances from different <code>bioCond</code> objects will be adjusted
according to the estimated prior df (based on the
underlying distributional theory).
These adjusted variance ratio factors are
exactly the ones stored in the returned <code>bioCond</code> objects.
See <code>estimatePriorDf</code> for details about estimating prior
df and accordingly adjusting variance ratio factors.
Note also that <code>fitMeanVarCurve</code>
uses exactly the set of intervals that
are utilized for fitting the mean-variance curve to estimate the prior
df and adjust the variance ratio factors (the set is controlled by the
argument <code>occupy.only</code>; see also
"Methods for Fitting a Mean-Variance Curve" above).
</p>
<p>Prior df is primarily used for the following
differential analysis. We call a variance read from a mean-variance
curve a prior one. In cases where you use
<code>diffTest</code> to call differential intervals
between two <code>bioCond</code>s, the final variance estimate associated
with each individual interval is obtained by averaging its observed
and prior variances, weighted by their respective numbers of degrees
of freedom.
</p>


<h3>Extending the Application Scope of a Mean-Variance Curve</h3>

<p>With a
set of <code>bioCond</code> objects at hand, you might want to use only
part of them to fit the mean-variance curve.
For example, suppose ChIP-seq samples
stored in some <code>bioCond</code> objects are associated with a low data
regularity (due to, e.g., bad sample qualities), and you don't
want to include these samples when fitting the curve. One way to work
around it is to exclude the <code>bioCond</code> objects from the fitting
process, extend the application scope of the fitted curve (via
<code>extendMeanVarCurve</code>) so that it applies to the excluded
<code>bioCond</code>s as well, and (optionally) re-assess the overall goodness
of fit via <code>estimatePriorDf</code> (see also the "Examples"
given for <code>extendMeanVarCurve</code>).
</p>
<p>There is another scenario where extending a mean-variance curve could be
useful. In practice, chances are that only one ChIP-seq sample is
available for each of two conditions to be compared. To make the
analysis possible, one way is to treat the two samples as replicates and
fit a mean-variance curve accordingly. The fitted curve can then be
associated with the two conditions each containing a single sample (via
<code>extendMeanVarCurve</code>),
and differential intervals between them
can be subsequently called following a regular routine (see "Examples"
provided in <code>extendMeanVarCurve</code>).
To be noted, this method is most suited when the two
conditions being compared are close. Otherwise, the method may lead to
an over-conserved <em>p</em>-value calculation.
