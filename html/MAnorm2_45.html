<h2>Scale a Mean-Variance Curve</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>scaleMeanVarCurve</code> underlies other interface functions for estimating
the variance ratio factor of an unadjusted mean-variance curve (or a set of
unadjusted mean-variance curves).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">scaleMeanVarCurve(z, m, d0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of which each element is a vector of FZ statistics
corresponding to a <code>bioCond</code> object (see also "Details").</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of numbers of replicates in <code>bioCond</code>
objects. Must correspond to <code>z</code> one by one in the same
order.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d0</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive real specifying the number of
prior degrees of freedom of the
mean-variance curve(s). <code>Inf</code> is allowed. Note that <code>d0</code> is
typically estimated via <code>estimateD0</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each <code>bioCond</code> object with replicate samples, a vector of
FZ statistics can be deduced from the unadjusted mean-variance curve
associated with it. More specifically, for each genomic interval in a
<code>bioCond</code> with replicate samples, its FZ statistic is defined to be
<code class="reqn">log(t_hat / v0)</code>, where <code class="reqn">t_hat</code> is the observed variance of signal
intensities of the interval, and <code class="reqn">v0</code> is the interval's prior variance
read from the corresponding mean-variance curve.
</p>
<p>Theoretically, each FZ statistic follows a scaled Fisher's Z distribution
plus a constant (since the mean-variance curve is not adjusted yet), and we
can use the sample mean (plus a constant that depends on the number of
prior degrees
of freedom) of the FZ statistics of each single <code>bioCond</code> to get
an estimate of log variance ratio factor.
</p>
<p>The final estimate of log variance ratio factor is a weighted mean of
estimates across <code>bioCond</code> objects, with the weights being their
respective numbers of genomic intervals that are used to calculate
FZ statistics.
This should be appropriate, as Fisher's Z distribution is roughly normal
(see also "References"). The weighted mean is actually a plain (unweighted)
mean across all the involved genomic intervals.
</p>
<p>Finally, we get an estimate of variance ratio factor by taking an
exponential.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The estimated variance ratio factor for adjusting the mean-variance
curve(s). Note that the function returns <code>NA</code> if there are not
sufficient genomic intervals for estimating it.
