The AIDSBlogs data set
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The AIDS blog data set records the pattern of citation among 146 unique blogs related to AIDS patients and their support networks. The data were originally collected by Gopal (2007) &lt;doi:10.1007/1-4020-5427-0_18&gt; over a randomly selected three-day period in August 2005. The nodes in the network correspond to blogs and a directed edge from one blog to another indicates that the former had a link to the latter in their web page.
