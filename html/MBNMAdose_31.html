<h2>Studies of treatments for Serum Uric Acid reduction in patients with gout</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset from a systematic review of interventions for lowering Serum Uric Acid (SUA) concentration in
patients with gout <strong>(not published previously)</strong>. The outcome is continuous, and aggregate data responses
correspond to the mean change from baseline in SUA in mg/dL at 2 weeks follow-up. The dataset includes 10
Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 5 different agents, and placebo. Data for one agent (RDEA)
arises from an RCT that is not placebo-controlled, and so is not connected to the network directly. In total
there were 19 different treatments (combination of dose and agent).
