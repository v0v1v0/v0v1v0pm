<h2>Studies of alogliptin for lowering blood glucose concentration in patients with type II diabetes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset from a systematic review of Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing different doses of
alogliptin with placebo (Langford et al. 2016). The systematic review was simply performed and was intended to
provide data to illustrate a statistical methodology rather than for clinical inference. Alogliptin is
a treatment aimed at reducing blood glucose concentration in type II diabetes. The outcome is continuous,
and aggregate data responses correspond to the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to follow-up in studies
of at least 12 weeks follow-up. The dataset includes 14 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 5
different doses of alogliptin with placebo, leading to 6 different treatments (combination of dose and agent)
within the network.
