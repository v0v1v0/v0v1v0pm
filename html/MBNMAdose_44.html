<h2>Studies of treatments for pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset from a systematic review of interventions for pain relief in osteoarthritis, used previously
in Pedder et al. (2019). The outcome is continuous, and aggregate data responses correspond to
the mean WOMAC pain score at 2 weeks follow-up. The dataset includes 18 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs),
comparing 8 different agents with placebo. In total there were 26 different treatments (combination of dose and
agent). The active treatments can also be grouped into 3 different classes, within which they have similar
mechanisms of action.
