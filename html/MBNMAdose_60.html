<h2>Studies of biologics for treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis (100% improvement)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset from a systematic review of Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing biologics at different doses and placebo
(Warren et al. 2019). The outcome is the number of patients experiencing 100% improvement on the Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index (PASI) measured at 12 weeks follow-up. The dataset
includes 19 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 8 different biologics at different doses with placebo.
