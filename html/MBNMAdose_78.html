<h2>Studies of triptans for headache pain relief</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset from a systematic review of interventions for pain relief in migraine (Thorlund et al. 2014).
The outcome is binary, and represents (as aggregate data) the proportion of participants who were
headache-free at 2 hours. Data are from patients who had had at least one migraine attack, who were
not lost to follow-up, and who did not violate the trial protocol. The dataset includes 70 Randomised-Controlled
Trials (RCTs), comparing 7 triptans with placebo. Doses are standardised as relative to a "common" dose,
and in total there are 23 different treatments (combination of dose and agent).
