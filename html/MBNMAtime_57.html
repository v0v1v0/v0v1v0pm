<h2>Identify unique comparisons relative to study reference treatment within a
network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identify unique contrasts relative to each study reference within a network.
Repetitions of the same treatment comparison are grouped together.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ref.comparisons(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing variables <code>studyID</code> and <code>treatment</code> (as
numeric codes) that indicate which treatments are used in which studies.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame of unique comparisons in which each row represents a
different comparison. <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> indicate the treatment codes that make
up the comparison. <code>nr</code> indicates the number of times the given comparison
is made within the network.
</p>
<p>If there is only a single observation for each study within the dataset
(i.e. as for standard network meta-analysis) <code>nr</code> will represent the number
of studies that compare treatments <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code>.
</p>
<p>If there are multiple observations for each study within the dataset (as in
MBNMAtime) <code>nr</code> will represent the number of time points in the
dataset in which treatments <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> are compared.
