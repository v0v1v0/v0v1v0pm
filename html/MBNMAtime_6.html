<h2>Studies comparing Tiotropium, Aclidinium and Placebo for maintenance treatment of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset from a systematic review of Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs) for maintenance treatment of moderate to severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Karabis et al. 2013). Data are extracted from (Tallarita et al. 2019).
SEs were imputed for three studies, and number of patients randomised were imputed for one study (LAS 39) in which they were missing,
using the median standard deviation calculated from other studies in the
dataset. The outcome is trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), measured in litres and reported in each study arm as mean
change from baseline to follow-up. The dataset includes 13 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 2 treatments (Tiotropium and
Aclidinium) and placebo.
