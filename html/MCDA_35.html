<h2>Approximative inference of an SRMP model given the lexicographic order of
the profiles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Approximative inference approach from pairwise comparisons of alternatives
for the SRMP ranking model. This method outputs an SRMP model that fulfils
as many pairwise comparisons as possible. The number of reference profiles
and their lexicographic order is fixed beforehand.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SRMPInferenceApproxFixedLexicographicOrder(
  performanceTable,
  criteriaMinMax,
  lexicographicOrder,
  preferencePairs,
  indifferencePairs = NULL,
  alternativesIDs = NULL,
  criteriaIDs = NULL,
  timeLimit = 60,
  populationSize = 20,
  mutationProb = 0.1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>performanceTable</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix or data frame containing the performance
table. Each row corresponds to an alternative, and each column to a
criterion. Rows (resp. columns) must be named according to the IDs of the
alternatives (resp. criteria).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>criteriaMinMax</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector containing the preference direction on each of
the criteria. "min" (resp. "max") indicates that the criterion has to be
minimized (maximized).  The elements are named according to the IDs of the
criteria.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lexicographicOrder</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing the indexes of the reference
profiles in a given order. The number of reference profiles to be used is
derrived implicitly from the size of this vector. The elements of this
vector need to be a permutation of the indices from 1 to its size.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>preferencePairs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A two column matrix containing on each row a pair of
alternative names where the first alternative is considered to be strictly
preferred to the second.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>indifferencePairs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A two column matrix containing on each row a pair
of alternative names the two alternatives are considered to indifferent with
respect to each other.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternativesIDs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector containing IDs of alternatives, according to
which the datashould be filtered.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>criteriaIDs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector containing IDs of criteria, according to which the
data should be filtered.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>timeLimit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Allows to fix a time limit of the execution, in seconds
(default 60).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>populationSize</code></td>
<td>
<p>Allows to change the size of the population used by
the genetic algorithm (default 20).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mutationProb</code></td>
<td>
<p>Allows to change the mutation probability used by the
genetic algorithm (default 0.1).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a list containing: </p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>criteriaWeights</code></td>
<td>
<p>The
inferred criteria weights.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>referenceProfiles</code></td>
<td>
<p>The inferred reference
profiles.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lexicographicOrder</code></td>
<td>
<p>The lexicographic order of the
reference profiles, in this case the one that was originally given as
input.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fitness</code></td>
<td>
<p>The percentage of fulfilled pair-wise relations.</p>
</td>
</tr>
