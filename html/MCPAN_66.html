<h2>
Testversion. Power calculation for multiple contrast tests (1-way ANOVA model)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Testversion. Calculate the power of a multiple contrast tests of k means in a model with homogeneous Gaussian errors, using the function pmvt(mvtnorm) to calculate multivariate t probabilities. Different options of power defineition are
"global": the overall rejection probability (the probability that at the elementary null is rejected for at least one contrast, irrespective of being under the elementary null or alternative), "anypair": the probability to reject any of the elementary null hypotheses for those contrasts that are under the elmentary alternatives, "allpair": and the probability that all elementary nulls are rejected which are indeed under the elementary nulls. See Sections 'Details' and 'Warnings'!
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">powermcpt(mu, n, sd, cmat = NULL, rhs=0, type = "Dunnett",
 alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"), alpha = 0.05,
 ptype = c("global", "anypair", "allpair"), crit = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>

<td><code>mu</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of expected values in the k treatment groups</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of sample sizes in the k treatment groups</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sd</code></td>
<td>
<p>a single numeric value, specifying the expected standard deviation of the residual error</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cmat</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional specification of a contrast matrix; if specified, it should have as many columns as there are groups in arguments <code>mu</code> and <code>n</code> and it should have at least 2 rows, if specified, argument <code>type</code> is ignored, if not specified, the contrast is determined by argument <code>type</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rhs</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector, specifying the right hand side of the hyptheses to test, defaults to 0, other specifications lead to tests of non-inferiority and superiority.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p> a single character string, naming one of the contrast types available in <code>contrMat(multcomp)</code>; argument is ignored if <code>cmat</code> is specified</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p> a single character string, specifying the direction of the alternative hypothesis, one of <code>"two.sided","less","greater"</code>. Note that this argument governs how the multivariate t probabilities are evaluated as well as the computation of the critical value if none is specified (i.e. default <code>crit=NULL</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p> a single numeric value, familywise type I error to be controlled, is ignored if argument <code>crit</code> is specified</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ptype</code></td>
<td>
<p> a single character string, naming the type of rejection probability to be computed; options are <code>"global"</code> for the global rejection probability,  <code>"anypair"</code> for the rejection probability considering only those contrasts under the alternative, <code>"global"</code> for the probability that all elementary alternatives are rejected. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>crit</code></td>
<td>
<p> a single numeric value to serve as equicoordinate critical point in the multiple test; if it is not specified, it is computed as a quantile of the multivariate t distribution based on the specifications in arguments <code>n</code>, <code>cmat</code> (or <code>type</code>); note that for alternatives <code>'two.sided'</code> and <code>'greater'</code>, <code>crit</code> should be a single positive value, while for alternative <code>'less'</code>, <code>crit</code> should be a single negative value. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p> further arguments, which are passed to the functions <code>qmvt</code> and <code>pmvt</code>, mainly to control the computation errors, see help <code>GenzBretz(mvtnorm)</code> for details</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In a homoscedastic Gaussian model with k possibly different means compared by (user-defined) multiple contrast tests, different types of rejection probabilities in the multiple testing problem can be computed.
Based on a central multivariate t distribution with df=sum(n)-k appropriate equicoordinate critical points for the test are computed, different critical points can be specified in <code>crit</code>
Computing probabilities of non-central multivariate t distributions <code>pmvt(mvtnorm)</code> one can calculate:
</p>
<p>The global rejection probability (<code>power="global"</code>), i.e. the probability that at least one of the elementary null hypotheses is rejected, irrespective, whether this (or any contrast!) is under the corresponding elementary alternative). As a consequence this probability involves elementary type-II-errors for those contrasts which are under their elementary null hypothesis.
</p>
<p>The probability to reject at least one of those elementary null hypotheses which are indeed under their corresponding elementary alternatives (<code>power="anypair"</code>). Technically, this is achieved by omitting those contrasts under the elementary null and compute the rejection probability for a given criticla value from a multivariate t distribution with reduced dimension. Note that for <code>'two-sided'</code> alternatives, type III-errors (rejection of the two-sided null in favor of the wrong direction) are included in the power.
</p>
<p>The probability to reject all elementary null hypotheses which are indeed under their corresponding elementary alternatives (<code>power="allpair"</code>). Also here, for 'two-sided' alternatives type III-error contribute to the computed 'allpair power'. Note further that two-sided allpair power is simulated based on multivariate t random numbers.
