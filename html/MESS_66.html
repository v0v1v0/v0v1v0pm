<h2>Power Calculations for Exact and Asymptotic McNemar Test in a 2 by 2 table</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute power of test, or determine parameters to obtain target power for
matched case-control studies.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">power_mcnemar_test(
  n = NULL,
  paid = NULL,
  psi = NULL,
  sig.level = 0.05,
  power = NULL,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "one.sided"),
  method = c("normal", "exact", "cond.exact")
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of observations (number of pairs)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>paid</code></td>
<td>
<p>The probability that a case patient is not exposed and that the
corresponding control patient was exposed (specifying p_12 in the 2 x 2 table). It is assumed that this is the _smaller_ of the two discordant probabilities.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>psi</code></td>
<td>
<p>The relative probability that a control patient is not exposed and that the corresponding case patient was exposed compared to the probability that a case patient is not exposed and that the corresponding control patient was exposed (i.e., p_21 / p_12 in the 2x2 table). Also called the discordant proportion ratio. psi must be larger than or equal to 1 since paid was the smaller of the two discordant probabilities.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sig.level</code></td>
<td>
<p>Significance level (Type I error probability)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>power</code></td>
<td>
<p>Power of test (1 minus Type II error probability)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>One- or two-sided test</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Power calculations based on exact or asymptotic test. The default (normal) corresponds to an approximative test, "exact" is the unconditional exact test, while "cond.exact" is a conditional exact test (given fixed n). The "exact" method is very slow for large values of n so it is most useful for fixed (and moderately-sized) n.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Object of class <code>power.htest</code>, a list of the arguments
(including the computed one) augmented with method and note elements.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p><code>uniroot</code> is used to solve power equation for unknowns, so you
may see errors from it, notably about inability to bracket the root when
invalid arguments are given.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Assume that pi_12 is 0.125 and we wish to detect an OR of 2.
# This implies that pi_12=0.25, and with alpha=0.05, and a power of 90% you get
power_mcnemar_test(n=NULL, paid=.125, psi=2, power=.9)

power_mcnemar_test(n=NULL, paid=.1, psi=2, power=.8, method="normal")
power_mcnemar_test(n=NULL, paid=.1, psi=2, power=.8)
