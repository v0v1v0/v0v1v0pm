<h2> Regression of a Heuristic Method for Identification of Low Outliers in Texas Annual Peak Streamflow </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Asquith and others (1995) developed a regression equation based on the first three moments of non-low-outlier truncated annual peak streamflow data in an effort to semi-objectively compute low-outlier thresholds for log-Pearson type III (Bulletin 17B consistent; IACWD, 1982) analyses (Asquith and Slade, 1997). A career hydrologist in for USGS in Texas, Raymond M. Slade, Jr., was particularly emphatic that aggressive low-outlier identification is needed for Texas hydrology as protection from mixed population effects.
</p>
<p>WHA and RMS heuristically selected low-outlier thresholds for 262 streamgages in Texas with at least 20 years from unregulated and unurbanized watersheds. These thresholds were then regressed, along with help from Linda Judd, against the product moments of the logarithms (base-10) of the whole of the sample data (zeros not included). The regression equation is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\log_{10}[AS_{\mathrm{Texas}}(\mu, \sigma, \gamma)]=1.09\mu-0.584\sigma+0.14\gamma - 0.799\mbox{,}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">AS_{\mathrm{Texas}}</code> is the low-outlier threshold, <code class="reqn">\mu</code> is the mean, <code class="reqn">\sigma</code> is the standard deviation, and <code class="reqn">\gamma</code> is skew. The R-squared is 0.75, and those authors unfortunately do not appear to list a residual standard error. The suggested limitations are <code class="reqn">1.9 &lt; \mu &lt; 4.842</code>, <code class="reqn">0.125 &lt; \sigma &lt; 1.814</code>, and <code class="reqn">-2.714 &lt; \gamma &lt; 0.698</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code class="reqn">AS_{\mathrm{Texas}}</code> equation was repeated in a footnote in Asquith and Roussel (2009, p. 19) because of difficulty in others acquiring copies of Asquith and others (1995). (File <code>AsquithLOT(1995).pdf</code> with this package is a copy.) Low-outlier thresholds using this regression were applied before the development of a generalized skew map in Texas (Judd and others, 1996) in turn used by Asquith and Slade (1997). A comparison of <code class="reqn">AS_{\mathrm{Texas}}</code> to the results of MGBT is shown in the <b>Examples</b>.
</p>
<p><b>The <code>ASlo</code> equation is no longer intended for any practical application with the advent of the MGBT approach.</b> It is provided here for historical context only and shows a heuristic line of thought independent from the mathematical rigor provided by TAC and others leading to MGBT. The <code class="reqn">AS_{\mathrm{Texas}}</code> incidentally was an extensive topic of long conversation between WHA and TAC at the National Surface Water Conference and Hydroacoustics Workshop (USGS Office of Surface Water), March 28–April 1, 2011, Tampa, Florida. The conversation was focused on the critical need for aggressive low-outlier identification in arid to semi-arid regions such as Texas. TAC was showcasing MGBT on a poster.
