<h2>Stochastic Pupation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Pupa first undergo one extra day of survival, calculated as a binomial over
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\overline{P_{[t-1]}} * (1-\mu_{ad})</code>
</p>
<p>.
This is an artifact of the conversion from continuous to discrete time (as mentioned
in the original Hancock paper this model is derived from). <br>
Then, pupation is sampled from a binomial, where <code class="reqn">(1-\overline{\phi})</code> is
the genotype-specific probability of becoming male, and <code class="reqn">\overline{\phi}</code>
is the genotype-specific of becoming female.
