<h2>Aggregate Output Over Landscape</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function aggregates the output of a run over the entire output, i.e., all
of the patches. It writes the output one level above the folder pointed to by
readDir, if writeDir is NULL. Output consists of 2 csv files, one for males and
one for females, "...M_LandscapeAgg_Run...csv".
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">aggregateOutput(readDir, writeDir=NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>readDir</code></td>
<td>
<p>Directory where output was written to</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>writeDir</code></td>
<td>
<p>Directory to write output to. Default is one level above readDir</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# This assumes user has run MGDrivE and output is in fPath.
#  See vignette for examples on how to run MGDrivE

# read/write dirs
fPath &lt;- "folder/containing/output"
oPath &lt;- "folder/to/write/stuff"

# first, split output by patch and aggregate females by mate genotype
# remember, cube is for example and changes with simulation
#  landscape aggregation will work if females are not aggregated, but it's slower
cube &lt;- cubeMendelian()

splitOutput(readDir = fPath, writeDir = NULL, remFile = TRUE)
aggregateFemales(readDir= fPath, writeDi = NULL, genotypes = cube$genotypesID,
                 remFile = TRUE)

# aggregate mosquitoes over entire landscape
#  no return value
