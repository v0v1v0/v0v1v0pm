<h3>Description</h3>

<p>MGDrivE: Mosquito Gene Drive Explorer
</p>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Recent developments of CRISPR-Cas9 based homing endonuclease gene drive systems,
for the suppression or replacement of mosquito populations, have generated much
interest in their use for control of mosquito-borne diseases (such as dengue,
malaria, Chikungunya and Zika). This is because genetic control of pathogen
transmission may complement or even substitute traditional vector-control
interventions, which have had limited success in bringing the spread of these
diseases to a halt. Despite excitement for the use of gene drives for mosquito
control, current modeling efforts have analyzed only a handful of these new
approaches (usually studying just one per framework). Moreover, these models
usually consider well-mixed populations with no explicit spatial dynamics. To
this end, we are developing MGDrivE (Mosquito Gene DRIVe Explorer), in
cooperation with the 'UCI Malaria Elimination Initiative', as a flexible
modeling framework to evaluate a variety of drive systems in spatial networks
of mosquito populations. This framework provides a reliable testbed to evaluate
and optimize the efficacy of gene drive mosquito releases. What separates MGDrivE
from other models is the incorporation of mathematical and computational
mechanisms to simulate a wide array of inheritance-based technologies within
the same, coherent set of equations. We do this by treating the population
dynamics, genetic inheritance operations, and migration between habitats as
separate processes coupled together through the use of mathematical tensor
operations. This way we can conveniently swap inheritance patterns whilst
still making use of the same set of population dynamics equations. This is a
crucial advantage of our system, as it allows other research groups to test
their ideas without developing new models and without the need to spend time
adapting other frameworks to suit their needs.
</p>


<h3>Brief Description</h3>

<p>MGDrivE is based on the idea that we can decouple the genotype inheritance
process from the population dynamics equations. This allows the system to be
treated and developed in three semi-independent modules that come together to
form the system. The way this is done will be described later in this document
but a reference diagram is shown here.
</p>


<h3>Previous Work</h3>

<p>The original version of this model was based on work by (Deredec et al. 2011; Hancock and Godfray 2007)
and adapted to accommodate CRISPR homing dynamics in a previous publication
by our team (Marshall et al. 2017).
As it was described, we extended this framework to be able to handle a variable
number of genotypes, and migration across spatial scenarios. We accomplish this
by adapting the equations to work in a tensor-oriented manner, where each
genotype can have different processes affecting their particular strain
(death rates, mating fitness, sex-ratio bias, et cetera).
</p>


<h3>Notation and Conventions</h3>

<p>Before beginning the full description of the model we will define some of the
conventions we followed for the notation of the written description of the system.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Overlines are used to denote the dimension of a tensor.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Subscript brackets are used to indicate an element in time. For example: <code class="reqn">L_{[t-1]}</code> is the larval population at time: <code class="reqn">t-1</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Parentheses are used to indicate the parameter(s) of a function. For example: <code class="reqn">\overline{O(T_{e}+T_{l})}</code> represents the function <code class="reqn">O</code> evaluated with the parameter: <code class="reqn">T_{e}+T_{l}</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Matrices follow a 'row-first' indexing order (i: row, j: column)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of one dimensional tensors, each slot represents a genotype of the
population. For example, the male population is stored in the following way:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\overline{Am} = \left(\begin{array}{c} g_1 \\ g_2 \\ g_3 \\ \vdots \\ g_n \end{array}\right) _{i}</code>
</p>

<p>All the processes that affect mosquitoes in a genotype-specific way are defined
and stored in this way within the framework.
</p>
<p>There are two tensors of squared dimensionality in the model: the adult females
matrix, and the genotype-specific male-mating ability (<code class="reqn">\overline{\eta}</code>)
In the case of the former the rows represent the females' genotype, whilst the
columns represent the genotype of the male they mated with:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\overline{\overline{Af}} = \left(\begin{array}{ccccc} g_{11} &amp; g_{12} &amp; g_{13} &amp; \cdots &amp; g_{1n}\\ g_{21} &amp; g_{22} &amp; g_{23} &amp; \cdots &amp; g_{2n}\\ g_{31} &amp; g_{32} &amp; g_{33} &amp; \cdots &amp; g_{3n}\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\ g_{n1} &amp; g_{n2} &amp; g_{n3} &amp; \cdots &amp; g_{nn} \end{array}\right) _{ij}</code>
</p>

<p>The genotype-specific male mating ability, on the other hand, stores the females'
genotype in the rows, and the male genotypes in the columns of the matrix.
