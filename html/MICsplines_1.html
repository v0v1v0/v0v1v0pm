<h2>
The Computing of Monotonic Spline Bases and Constrained Least-Squares Estimates
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package provides C implementation for the computing of monotonic spline bases, including M-splines, I-splines, and C-splines, denoted by MIC splines. The definitions of the spline bases are described in Meyer (2008). The package also provides the computing of constrained least-squares estimates when a subset of or all of the regression coefficients are constrained to be non-negative, as described in Fraser and Massam (1989).
