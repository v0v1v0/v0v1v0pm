<h2>Perceived accessibility data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data come from a survey that was conducted in rural clusters of 
Tanzania in 1993. The goal was to collect information on the perceived 
accessibility of a specific family planning facility that serviced each 
cluster. Six informants were chosen: 3 female and 3 male. New informants 
were chosen for each cluster. Each informant was independently asked to 
rate the accessibility of the facility, and how easy it was to get to the
facility. More specifically the women informants were asked to rate how 
women of childbearing age perceived the accessibility and easiness and 
men were asked to rate how accessible and easy men perceived access to 
the clinic to be. Higher values indicate greater accessibility and ease 
of travel. The female informants' ratings are 1 to 3 and the male 
informants' ratings are 4 to 6.
