<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The survival integral has a similar structure for the different model
predictors. It is always a sum over all individuals, followed by the
multiplication with a pre-integral factor (pre_fac). For the gamma predictor
a pre-integral vector is next. Then, the integral itself consists of a
weighted sum (weights) of gauss-quadrature integration points weighted by
the survival time of the individuals (survtime). Inside the integral, the
current additive predictor (omega) is multiplied with an in-integral vector
(int_vec), except for predictor gamma. All longitudinal predictors
addtitionally include an in-integration factor (int_fac).
</p>
<p>The difference between predictors "long" and "fpc_re" is that the latter
makes efficient use of the block structure of the design matrix for
unconstrained functional principal component random effects. The outputs
also differ as the Hessian for "fpc_re" is a diagonal matrix, so only the
diagonal elements are returned.
