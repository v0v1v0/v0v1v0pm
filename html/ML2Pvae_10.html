<h2>ML2Pvae: A package for creating a VAE whose decoder recovers the parameters of the ML2P model.
The encoder can be used to predict the latent skills based on assessment scores.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The ML2Pvae package includes functions which build a VAE with the desired architecture, and
fits the latent skills to either a standard normal (independent) distrubution,
or a multivariate normal distribution with a full covariance matrix. Based on the work 
"Interpretable Variational Autoencdoers for Cognitive Models"
by Curi, M., Converse, G., Hajewski, J., and Oliveira, S. 
Found in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2019.
