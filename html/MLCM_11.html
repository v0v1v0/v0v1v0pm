<h2> Create data frame for Fitting Conjoint Measurment Models by glm </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>make.wide</code> and <code>make.wide.full</code> generate a <code class="reqn">n</code> x <code class="reqn">q - 1</code> matrix from an <code class="reqn">n</code> x <code class="reqn">2</code> column subset of a data frame storing the results of a conjoint measurement experiment, where <code class="reqn">n</code> is the number of trials and <code class="reqn">q</code> is the number of levels per dimension in the stimulus set tested. Currently, <code>make.wide.full</code> is limited to data sets with only 2 stimulus dimensions. The columns code covariates for all but the first stimulus level, which is constrained to be 0, along each dimension.  These columns take the value 0 unless one of the stimuli in the trial corresponded to a level along that dimension, in which case it takes a 1 or a -1, depending on which of the two stimuli represented that level. If both stimuli represent the same level for a dimension, then they cancel out and the column contains a 0.  This function is used for each dimension along which the stimuli vary to create a design matrix for each dimension.  The final design matrix is constructed inside the <code>mlcm</code> method by putting together the design matrices from each dimension.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">make.wide(d)

make.wide.full(d)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code class="reqn">n x 2</code> column data frame.  The columns give the indices of the levels of the dimensions along which the two stimuli presented in a trial vary.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a helper function, normally used inside <code>mlcm</code>, and not typically exploited by the casual user.  
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame with <code class="reqn">n</code> rows and <code class="reqn">q - 1</code> columns
</p>
<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>D2â€“Dq</code></td>
<td>
<p>For each dimension along which the stimulus can vary, there are <code class="reqn">q - 1</code> columns coding the absence or presence of that level of the dimension in the stimulus.  If the level is present, then the value is -1 or 1 as a function of which of the two stimuli contained that level, unless both do, in which case it is, also, 0. </p>
