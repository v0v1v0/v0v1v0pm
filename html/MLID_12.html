<h2>MLID: a package for calculating a multilevel index of dissimilarity</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tools for fitting a multilevel index of dissimilarity to geographically
hierarchical data. The results measure the two principal dimensions of
segregation, unevenness and clustering. The amount of segregation,
scale effects and the impact of particular places on the overall index can
be assessed. The package development was funded partly under the ESRC's
Urban Big Data Centre <a href="http://ubdc.ac.uk/">http://ubdc.ac.uk/</a>, grant ES/L011921/1.
