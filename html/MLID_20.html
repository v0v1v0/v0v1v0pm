<h2>Sum the data up into higher level groups</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Aggregates the data into higher level groups by calculating the sum
of all the numeric data columns by group
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sumup(data, sumby, drop = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with <code>ncol(data) &gt;= 2</code>. Each row of the data
represents a neighbourhood or some other areal unit for which counts of
population have been made.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sumby</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character or numeric vector of length 1 identifying either
the name or columns position of the variables in <code>data</code> that records the
higher-level group into which the data will be aggregated (summed)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drop</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character or numeric vector identifying any variables to be
dropped from the aggregated data, such as lower-level names and identifiers</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Sometimes a population group is too few in number sensibly to be analysed at
the smallest area scale. An indication of this is when the expected value
under randomisation of the index of dissimilarity is a large fraction of the
observed value. In this case, the data can be aggregated into higher level
units, summing the population counts. Aggregating the data also can be used
to explore how the index changes with the scale of analysis.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a data frame containing the aggregated data
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>id</code>
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
data(ethnicities)
head(ethnicities)
id(ethnicities, vars = c("Arab","Other","Persons"), expected = TRUE)
# the expected value is very high relative to the ID
aggdata &lt;- sumup(ethnicities, sumby = "LSOA", drop = "OA")
head(aggdata)
id(aggdata, vars=c("Arab","Other","Persons"), expected = TRUE)
# Note the sensitivity of the ID to the scale of analysis

## End(Not run)
data(aggdata)
head(aggdata)
moreagg &lt;- sumup(ethnicities, sumby = "MSOA", drop = "LSOA")
head(moreagg)
</code></pre>
