<h2>Predictions from gbm and random forest on the Sonar test data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

testing (51 points), a gbm model was fitted using Caret 
on the training data. Then these are the predicted 
probabilities of the model on the test data. A random
forest model was then fit and tested in the same manner. 
The probabilities and ground truth labels were combined 
horizontally for further analysis.
