<h2>Pathway case</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculation of pathway values, defined as the difference between residuals of
full model and reduced model lacking the pathway variable. The larger the
difference, the more a case qualifies as a pathway case suitable for the
analysis of mechanisms.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pathway(full_model, reduced_model)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>full_model</code></td>
<td>
<p>Full model including covariate of interest
(= pathway variable)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reduced_model</code></td>
<td>
<p>Reduced model excluding covariate of interest</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The difference between the absolute residuals of the full and reduced model
follows the approach developed by Weller and Barnes (2014): <em>Finding
Pathways: Mixed-Method Research for Studying Causal Mechanisms.</em>
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

</p>
<p>The calculation of the absolute difference between the full-model and
reduced-model residuals, given a case's reduced-model residual is larger
than its full-model residual, follows the proposal by
Gerring (2007): Is There a (Viable) Crucial-Case Method?
<em>Comparative Political Studies</em> 40 (3): 231-253.

</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe with
</p>
<p>- all full model variables,
</p>
<p>- full model residuals (<code>full_resid</code>),
</p>
<p>- reduced model residuals (<code>reduced_resid</code>),
</p>
<p>- pathway values following Weller/Barnes (<code>pathway_wb</code>),
</p>
<p>- pathway values following Gerring (<code>pathway_gvalue</code>),
</p>
<p>- variable showing whether Gerring's criterion for a pathway
case is met (<code>pathway_gstatus</code>)
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">df_full &lt;- lm(mpg ~ disp + wt, data = mtcars)
df_reduced &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
pathway(df_full, df_reduced)

</code></pre>
