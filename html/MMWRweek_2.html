</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<td><code>date</code></td>

<p>vector which can be coerced to class <code>Date</code></p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The first day of any MMWR week is Sunday. MMWR week numbering is sequential 
beginning with 1 and incrementing with each week to a maximum of 52 or 53. 
MMWR week #1 of an MMWR year is the first week of the year that has at least 
four days in the calendar year. For example, if January 1 occurs on a Sunday, 
Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, the calendar week that includes January 1 would 
be MMWR week #1. If January 1 occurs on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, the 
calendar week that includes January 1 would be the last MMWR week of the previous 
year (#52 or #53). Because of this rule, December 29, 30, and 31 could potentially 
fall into MMWR week #1 of the following MMWR year.
