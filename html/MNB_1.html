<h2>Alzheimer data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Alzheimer’s data is presented in Hand and Taylor (1987) and Hand and
Crowder (1996) to assess deterioration aspects of intellect, self-care and
personality in senile patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Two groups of patients
were compared, one of which received a placebo and the other treatment with
lecithin. In the data, each of the subjects, 26 in the placebo group and 22
in the lecithin group, were measured on five occasions (initially, 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th).
The measurements were the number of words that the patients could recalled from lists of words.
