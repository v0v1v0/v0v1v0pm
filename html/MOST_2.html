<h2>Random Assignment Generator for a Factorial Experiment with Many Conditions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function provides a list of random numbers that can be used to assign
participants to conditions (cells) in an experiment with many conditions, such as a factorial
experiment.  The randomization is restricted as follows:  if the number of participants
available is a multiple of the number of conditions, then cell sizes will be
balanced; otherwise, they will be as near balanced as possible.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">RandomAssignmentGenerator(N, C)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>The total number of participants to be randomized.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C</code></td>
<td>
<p>The total number of conditions for the experiment you are planning.  Note that f
or a complete factorial experiment having k factors, there will be 2^k conditions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe with 1 variable ranList with N observations, each observation of ranList
provides a random number for each participant. This will be a number from 1 to C.
For example, if the 4th number in the list is 7, the 4th subject is randomly assigned
to experiment condition 7. Random numbers will be generated so that the experiment is
approximately balanced.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">result &lt;- RandomAssignmentGenerator(35,17)
print(result)
</code></pre>
