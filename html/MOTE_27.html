<h2>Mixed Two-way ANOVA Example Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dataset for use in <code>ges.partial.SS.mix</code>.
Given previous research, we know that backward strength
in free association tends to increase the ratings
participants give when you ask them how many people
out of 100 would say a word in response to a target
word (like Family Feud). This result is tied to
people's overestimation of how well they think they
know something, which is bad for studying. So, we
gave people instructions on how to ignore the BSG.
Did it help? Is there an interaction between BSG
and instructions given?
