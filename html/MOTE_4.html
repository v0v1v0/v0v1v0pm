<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dataset for use in <code>v.chi.sq</code>,
Individuals were polled and asked to report their number of friends
(low, medium, high) and number of kids (1, 2, 3+)
to determine if there was a relationship between friend
groups and number of children. It was hypothesized that
those with more children may have less time for
friendship maintaining activities.
