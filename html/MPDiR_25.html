<h2> Psychometric Functions for Vernier Judgement of Phase Difference between Drifting Gratings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A pair of adjacent, horizontal luminance gratings (sine- or square-wave spatial profiles, 0.8 cycles/degree and equal contrast = 0.30) drifting at 2 or 8 Hz.  The gratings were separated by a 30-arcmin lateral gap.  On each trial, the grating pair was drifting either upward or downward and the phase shift between the gratings was chosen at one of 8 values between -50 and 50 degrees.  The observer was instructed to report which grating appeared shifted upward.  The method of constant stimuli was used.
