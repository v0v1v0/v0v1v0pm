<h2> Confidence Ratings for Detection of Luminance Patch</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from a detection task in which the observer gave ratings (1â€“5) indicating his confidence that a signal was presented on that trial.  The signal was a 3 deg square patch of luminance, fixated centrally, embedded in a 10 deg field of random luminance pixels.  The signal was 64 x 64 pixels.  During the experiment, 6 luminance contrast levels were randomly presented and at an equal rate, randomly interspersed catch-trials in which the signal was absent.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(ConfRates)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 196 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Contrast</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the luminance contrast of the signal, 0 is a catch trial.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Rating</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the confidence rating of the observer as to the presence of the signal</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Stim</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a logical vector indicating whether the signal was present or not on the trial</p>
</dd>
</dl>
