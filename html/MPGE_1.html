<h2>An example of data of the environmental variable (e.g., smoking status).
Here, environment_data is a data frame with single column for the environmental
variable. The order of the 500 individuals in the row must be the same as provided
in the phenotype and genotype data. Here, the environmental variable has two
categories which were coded as 1 and 0 (e.g., smokers and non-smokers).
Instead of numeric values, these can also be considered to be factors in
the absence of a defined order in the categories.</h2>
