<h2>An example of step 1 (marginal genetic association) and step 2 (GxE interaction)
p-values across genetic variants (SNPs).
Here, mv_G_GxE_pvalues is a data.frame with three columns. First column
lists the set of 1000 genetic variants. Second column provides
the vector of p-values obtained from testing the marginal multivariate
genetic association for these SNPs. And the third column provides the
vector of p-values obtained from testing the overall GxE effect
in presence of possible marginal genetic effect and marginal environmental effect.</h2>
