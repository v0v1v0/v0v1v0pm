<h2>Radon Release</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Percentage of radon from water released in showers with orifices
of various diameters.  Four replicates were obtained, but it should
be noted that the temperatures for the replicates (in degrees Celsius) are
21, 30, 38, and 46, respectively.  This information should really be
accounted for in any serious analysis of the data.
