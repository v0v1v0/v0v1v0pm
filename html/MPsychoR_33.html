<h2>
Perceived Tension in Music Over Time
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset comes from an experiment described Vines et al. (2006; the data were slightly modified). The authors were interested in how physical gestures of professional musicians contribute to the perception of emotion in a musical performance. 29 participants were exposed to the performance by either just listening (condition "auditory"), just seeing (condition "visual""), or both (condition "auditory-visual"). During the performance the participants had to move a slider to indicate the experienced tension they felt. They listened to the piece for 80 sec; every 10 msec the tension score (0 to 127) was recorded. This results in 800 tension measurement points per person (here provided as z-scores).
