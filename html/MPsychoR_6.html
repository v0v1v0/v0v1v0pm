Brain Size and Intelligence
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Willerman et al. (1991) conducted their study at a large southwestern university. They selected a sample of 40 right-handed Anglo introductory psychology students who had indicated no history of alcoholism, unconsciousness, brain damage, epilepsy, or heart disease. These subjects were drawn from a larger pool of introductory psychology students with total Scholastic Aptitude Test Scores higher than 1350 or lower than 940 who had agreed to satisfy a course requirement by allowing the administration of four subtests (Vocabulary, Similarities, Block
Design, and Picture Completion) of the Wechsler (1981) Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised. With prior approval of the University's research review board, students selected for MRI were required to obtain prorated full-scale IQs of greater than 130 or less than 103, and were equally divided by sex and IQ classification.
