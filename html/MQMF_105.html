<h2>twoindex has orange roughy catches with hypothetical cpue</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>twoindex is a 35 x 4 data.frame of fishery data made 
up of smoothed real catches but two simulated indices of relative
abundance. This data-set is designed to be used to illustrate
the implementation of surplus production models when there are
more than one time-series of relative abundance indices. This is not
currently implemented in the book but is put here for use by readers
should they wish to pursue this approach. The
indices have been designed to generate a workable answer but also
require the use of a penalty on harvest rates to avoid massively 
inflated harvest rates well above 1. Instead of using simpspm,
spm, and negLL1, we need to use simpspmM, spmCE, and negLLM.
The cpue series are hypothetical and have been designed to 
illustrate the use of penalty1 and the use of multiple indices 
of relative abundance. The real stock assessment uses acoustic 
survey indices and also uses many years of age composition data 
inside Stock Synthesis 3, not surprisingly the inclusion of real
time-series of indices and of age-composition data leads to very 
different results.
