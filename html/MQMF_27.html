<h2>domed calculates domed selectivity curves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>domed uses 6 parameters and a set of mean size or age classes 
to calculate a domed selectivity curve with a maximum of 1.0 (rescaling 
can be done outside the function), but has parameters for the selectivity 
of the initial and final size/age classes. There is an ascending limb and 
a descending limb with the potential of a plateau in between. The six 
parameters are 1) the age/size where selectivity first becomes 1.0, 
2) the size/age where selectivity first begins to decline, 3) the 
steepness of the ascending limb, 4) the steepness of the descending limb, 
5) the selectivity of the first age/size class, and 6) the selectivity of 
the last age/size class. The descending limb of any dome shaped 
selectivity curves imply that the fishing gear used is unable to collect 
all representatives of the larger or older classes. The predicted numbers
of smaller or younger animals, that are only partially selected, are 
inflated because of the partial selection. If any larger or older animals 
are, in fact, caught, then the same inflation can happen to those animals 
as a result of the partial selection implied by the dome shape. Small and 
young animals weight very little, the same cannot be said for the larger 
or older animals. Some people refer to the extra biomass this phenomenon
can imply as 'ghost biomass', even though it might be real. Whatever the
case, when using dome shaped selectivity it is best to be aware of this
issue and to be cautious about how this is interpreted.
