<h2>getseed generates a random number seed</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>getseed generates a seed for use within set.seed. 
It produces up to a 7 digit integer from the Sys.time. 
Initially, at the start of a session there is no seed; a new one 
is created from the current time and the process ID when one is 
first required. Here, in getseed, we do not use the process ID so 
the process is not identical but this at least allows the 
set.seed value to be stored should the need to repeat a set of 
simulations arise. The process generates up to a seven digit number
it then randomly reorders those digits and that becomes the seed.
That way, if you were to call getseed in quick succession the
seeds generated should differ even when they are generated close
together in time.
