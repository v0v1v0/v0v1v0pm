<h2>gettime calculates time in seconds passed each day</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>gettime is a function designed to facilitate the measurement
of time between intervals within R software that are expected to
take a maximum of hours. It calculates the time as seconds elapsed 
from the start of each day. As long as the timing of events does not
pass from one day to the next accurate results will be generated. To 
measure the time taken one would store an initial value that would be 
subtracted from a final value.
