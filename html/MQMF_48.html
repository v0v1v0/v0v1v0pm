<h2>LatA Simulated length-at-age for 358 female fish</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data.frame containing the simulated 
age for an array of different lengths based upon the properties
of an extensive collection of redfish (<em>Centroberyx affinis</em>) 
length-at-age data from eastern Australia sampled in the 1990's.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data.frame with 358 rows and 2 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>simulated ages in years</p>
</dd>
<dt>length</dt>
<dd>
<p>consequent simulated fork length of the fish, in cms</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The data this simulation is based upon is from length-at-age 
data for one species collected over many years by the many 
excellent people running the Integrated Stock Monitoring Program 
in the Australian South East Fishery over the years of its 
existence. The simulation is based on a characterization of 
redfish properties and includes random error in the hypothetical 
measurements as well as the processes of growth (i.e. both 
measurement and process error). The other inputs were a selected 
set of growth parameters and the relative frequency of different 
ages vs lengths.
