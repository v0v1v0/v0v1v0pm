<h2>linter finds a value in a series using its location in another</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>linter is a tool for linearly interpolating in a 2-D
cartesian space to search out an unknown value between two known
points on the x-axis, based on a known value between two known 
points on the y-axis. This might be answering the question of
what would be the length at 50 percent maturity for a curve with no 
analytical solution. We could find two points in a series of
proportion values on the y-axis that bracketed the 50 percent value 
using the function bracket. They would be associated with the two 
length values on the x-axis used to generate the predicted 
proportion values. If we assume the various points in the 2-D 
space to be approximated by linear relations then the location 
between the two known x-axis length values corresponding to the 
L50 would have the same ratio as the 50 percent value has to the two
points on the y-axis. See the example for details. The input
arguments include five values, left, right, bottom, top, and 
target. So, left and right are sequential values on the x-axis, 
bottom and top are the corresponding sequential values on the 
y-axis, and target is the value we are looking for on the y-axis.
