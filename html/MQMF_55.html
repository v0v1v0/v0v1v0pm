<h2>minnow contains weekly growth data for use with seasonal growth curves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>minnow is a dataset of mean length against time in weeks for
minnows (<em>Phoxinus phoxinus</em>), derived from Pitcher &amp; 
Macdonald (1973) for use when fitting growth curves, especially 
seasonal growth curves. The data exhibit increases and decreases 
in length as each year progresses because these are mean lengths 
rather than individual measurements (which would, more typically,
be used these days). The data have been read off a graph within 
the original paper as it is not reported explicitly, and are 
therefore only approximate, but will do for our purposes (but 
expect different parameters to those reported in the original 
paper). This is length at time not age. Though time is being 
used as a proxy for age there is no age 0.
