<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An operating model component that specifies the degree of adherence to management recommendations (Implementation error)
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Name</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the Implementation error object. Single value. Character string.</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>TACFrac</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Mean fraction of recommended TAC that is actually taken. For
each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution
specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the mean TAC
fraction obtained across all years of that simulation, and a yearly TAC frac is
drawn from a log-normal distribution with the simulation mean and a coefficient
of variation specified by the value of <code>TACSD</code> drawn for that simulation. If
the value drawn is greater than 1 the amount of catch taken is greater than
that recommended by the TAC, and if it is less than 1 the amount of catch taken
is less than that recommended by the TAC. Positive real numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TACSD</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Log-normal coefficient of variation in the fraction of
recommended TAC that is actually taken. For each historical simulation a single
value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower
bounds provided. This value is used, along with the <code>TACFrac</code> drawn for that
simulation, to create a log-normal distribution that yearly values specifying
the actual amount of catch taken are drawn from. Positive real numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TAEFrac</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Mean fraction of recommended TAE that is actually taken. For
each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution
specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the mean TAE
fraction obtained across all years of that simulation, and a yearly TAE frac is
drawn from a log-normal distribution with the simulation mean and a coefficient
of variation specified by the value of <code>TAESD</code> drawn for that simulation. If
the value drawn is greater than 1 the amount of effort employed is greater than
that recommended by the TAE, and if it is less than 1 the amount of effort
employed is less than that recommended by the TAE. Positive real numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TAESD</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Log-normal coefficient of variation in the fraction of
recommended TAE that is actually taken. For each historical simulation a single
value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower
bounds provided. This value is used, along with the <code>TAEFrac</code> drawn for that
simulation, to create a log-normal distribution that yearly values speciying
the actual amount of efort employed are drawn from. Positive real numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SizeLimFrac</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Mean fraction of recommended size limit that is actually
retained. For each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform
distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is
the mean size limit fraction obtained across all years of that simulation, and
a yearly size limit fraction is drawn from a log-normal distribution with the
simulation mean and a coefficient of variation specified by the value of
<code>SizeLimSD</code> drawn for that simulation. If the value drawn is greater than 1 the
size of fish retained is greater than that recommended by the size limit, and
if it is less than 1 the amount of size of fish retained is less than that
recommended by the size limit. Positive real numbers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SizeLimSD</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Log-normal coefficient of variation in the fraction of
recommended size limit that is actually retained. For each historical
simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the
upper and lower bounds provided. This value is used, along with the
<code>SizeLimFrac</code> drawn for that simulation, to create a log-normal distribution
that yearly values speciying the actual fraction of the size limit retained are
drawn from. Positive real numbers.</p>
