<h2>A formatted version of the standard DFO performance plot, color coded by thresholds</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Crit_S is the probability of being in the critical zone in the first 10 projected years
Caut_S is the probability of being in the cautious zone in the first 10 projected years
Health_S is the probability of being in the healthy zone in the first 10 projected years
OvFish_S is the probability of overfishing in the first 10 projected years
Yield_S is the mean yield relative to FMSY management over the first 10 projected years
Crit is the probability of being in the critical zone in the last 10 projected years
Caut is the probability of being in the cautious zone in the last 10 projected years
Health is the probability of being in the healthy zone in the last 10 projected years
OvFish is the probability of overfishing in the last 10 projected years
Yield is the mean yield relative to FMSY management over the last 10 projected years
AAVY is the average annual variability in yield over the whole projection phrased as a CV percentage
Reb is the probability the stock has rebuilt to over BMSY in 2 mean generation times

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DFO_tab_formatted(
  Ptab1,
  thresh = c(30, 50, 40, 60, 50, 20, 40, 50, 60, 50, 30, 50),
  ret_thresh = F
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Ptab1</code></td>
<td>
<p>A DFO performance table made by DFO_tab()</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>A vector of thresholds for each column Health, Yield and Reb are 'greater than threshold' conditions</p>
</td>
