<h2>Spatial Deviation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute the deviation of each territorial unit as regards  
to its geographical neighborhood. Neighborhood is defined either
by contiguity order, by a distance value or by a personal matrix (travel time...)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sdev(x, var1, var2, type = "rel", xid, order, dist, mat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a sf object including var1 and var2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var1</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of the numerator variable in x.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var2</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of the denominator variable in x.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>type of deviation; "rel" for relative deviation, "abs" for 
absolute deviation (see Details).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xid</code></td>
<td>
<p>identifier field in x (to be used for importing a personal distance matrix). 
Default to the first column of x. (optional)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
<p>contiguity order.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist</code></td>
<td>
<p>distance threshold defining the contiguity. The cartesian 
distance between units centroids is used by default;
use mat to apply different metrics.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>a distance matrix (road distance, travel time...) between x units. 
Row and column names must fit xid identifiers. (optional)</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The relative spatial deviation is the ratio between var1/var2 and 
var1/var2 in the specified neighborhood. Values greater than 100 indicate 
that the unit ratio is greater than the ratio in its neighborhood. Values 
lower than 100 indicate that the unit ratio is lower than the ratio in its 
neighborhood.<br>
The absolute spatial deviation is the amount of numerator that could be 
moved to obtain the same ratio in all units of its neighborhood.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector is returned.
