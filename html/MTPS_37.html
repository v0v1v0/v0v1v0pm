<h2>HIV Drug Resistance Database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data from HIV Drug Resistance Database used for demonstration. After processing, <code>YY</code> contains 5 response variables variable for 1246 observations and <code>XX</code> are 228 predictors of those 1246 obsevations.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the HIV database, the resistance of five Nucleoside RT Inhibitor (NRTI) drugs were used as multivariate outcomes, including Lamivudine (3TC), Abacavir(ABC), Zidovudine (AZT), Stavudine (D4T), Didanosine (DDI). The mutation variables are used as the predictors. Some mutation variables were removed as they do not contain enough variation. The final outcome data is a matrix of size 1246 × 5, and the predictor data is a matrix of 1246 × 228 values, which is provided in the package called "HIV". In the example data in the package, "YY" refers the outcome data and "XX" refers the predictor data.
