<h2>Transient sleep disorder</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Clinical study designed to compare the automated and semi-automated scoring of 
Polysomnographic (PSG) recordings used to diagnose transient sleep disorders. 
The study considered 82 patients who were given a sleep-inducing drug (Zolpidem 
10 mg). Measurements of latency to persistent sleep (LPS: lights out to the 
beginning of 10 consecutive minutes of uninterrupted sleep) were obtained using 
six different methods.
