Total causal effect of a node on another node
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Total causal effect of a node on another node.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ida(x, y, G, dataset)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>A number between 1 and the number of variables (nodes) indicating the node whose total causal effect we want to estimate. This is the independent variable. See details for more on this.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>

<p>A number between 1 and the number of variables (nodes) indicating the node who is the dependent variable. The goal is to estimate the total 
causal effect of x on y.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>G</code></td>
<td>

<p>A square matrix representing a (partially) directed graph which contains 0s and 1s. If G[i, j] = 2 it 
means there is an arrow from node i to node j. If G[i, j] = 1, there is an undirected edge between nodes i and j and there is no edge between nodes i and j if G[i, j] = 0.  
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataset</code></td>
<td>

<p>The dataset. This is a numerical matrix with data.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The total causal effect defined in Pearl's do-calculus is E(Y|do(X=z+1)) - E(Y|do(X=z)). As Pearl described it, he used linear regression, hence this funciton works for continuous data which are assumed to be Gaussian.
</p>
<p>We estimate a set of possible total causal effects using linear regression. if y is a parent, or a descendant, of x in G, the estimated causal effect of x on y is zero. If y is not a parent of x, we take the regression coefficient of x in the regression lm(y ~ x + pa(x)), where pa(x) denotes the parents of x. This is repeated using all parents of x (including the empty set) and all possible parents values of x and their combinations.
</p>
<p>One restriction to bear in mind. If a collider is created that combination of nodes is not used in the regression. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A lis tincluding:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tc</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix with 4 elements. The first columns one is the estimated beta coefficient, the second is its standard error, its t-value and the p-value for testing whether this is equal to 0.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mess</code></td>
<td>

<p>If the x node has no parents a message about this appears. Otherwise this is NULL.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
