<h2>
A Function to Filter and Save Genomic Features from NCBI (all builds)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>GetGeneList</code> allows the user to access the NCBI database for the species specified using the secure ftp site, download feature information as well as filter and save feature information for future use. This update now allows users to specify if the latest assembly build should be used or not using the <span class="pkg">rentrez</span> package. Once the <code>GetGeneList</code> function is complete, no other access to NCBI or the internet is required. This function requires user input to determine the feature and class types that will be retained during the filtering process. Note: The requirements for this function have changed slightly due to NCBI ftp site organization changes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GetGeneList(Species,latest = TRUE, savefiles = TRUE, destfile)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Species</code></td>
<td>

<p>This term designates the species to be used in the function and is dependent on the scientific name.
Options: Must include in quotation marks, where the genus and species should be separated by a space (e.g., "Bos taurus").
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>latest</code></td>
<td>

<p>Default is true. This term indicates if the most recent (latest) assembly build for that species should be used to get genomic features for. If set to false, the user will be prompted to idenify the assembly to use. In some species, the same assembly link may be listed more than once (e.g. GCF_000003055.6_Bos_taurus_UMD_3.1.1 vs. GCF_000003055.5_Bos_taurus_UMD_3.1.1). In any case, there is a number that designates one with a higher file number (e.g., "3055.6" vs. "3055.5" for Bos taurus 3.1). Always start with the higher file number for that build as it likely contains the feature table. If this fails, then try the other version. The assembly build should always match the marker map file build.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>savefiles</code></td>
<td>

<p>Default is true. This term allows you to save the original feature list downloaded from the NCBI database as a text file as well as the filtered feature list produced from the function only if set to TRUE.
Options: Must be either TRUE or FALSE.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>destfile</code></td>
<td>

<p>This is the pathway to the computer location in which files will be saved and must be specified using quotation marks (e.g., <code>getwd()</code>).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In running this function, the user will be prompted to enter feedback after the file downloads. Items that will be requested, if multiples are present include 1) primary feature type and 2) primary class type to prioritize filtering the dataset on. In each case, the user can opt to keep all feature and class types. This will mean that duplicate information is available per gene ID. If filtered, all unique gene ID will be returned, where preference is given to the class feature and class types specified. Gene ID without the preferred feature and class types will be queried for their available information and added while still removing duplicates. The file returned contains 20 columns based on the current NCBI file structure. Those column headings and descriptions are provided below in the <code>Value</code> section.
</p>
<p>Note: While waiting for the function to run, if the user presses "Enter" prematurely, this will result in the function not running correctly and it will have to be started over. Please read instructions carefully.
</p>
<p>If <code>savefiles = TRUE</code>, then both the original file from NCBI and the filtered file the user specified will be saved in the <code>destfile</code> location. Once the function has run, the user can choose to either use the information at that time or call it later using the saved file. In either case, the output from the filtered file can be used with marker data to run the <code>MapMarkers</code> function that is also a part of this package.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Column headings and descriptions returned to the user from the <code>GetGeneList</code> function.
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>feature</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of feature based on INSDC, which can include GENE, RNA (various types), and CDS.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>class</code></td>
<td>
<p>Gene features are subdivided into classes according to the gene biotype. ncRNA features are subdivided according to the ncRNA_class. CDS features are subdivided into with_protein and without_protein, depending on whether the CDS feature has a protein accession assigned or not. CDS features marked as without_protein include CDS features for C regions and V/D/J segments of immunoglobulin and similar genes that undergo genomic rearrangement, and pseudogenes.</p>

<td>
<p>Accession.version of the assembly.</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>non-redundant_refseq</code></td>
<td>
<p>For bacteria and archaea assemblies, this column contains the non-redundant WP_ protein accession corresponding to the CDS feature. This may be the same as the previous column for RefSeq genomes annotated directly with WP_ RefSeq proteins, or may be different for genomes annotated with genome-specific protein accessions (e.g. NP_ or YP_ RefSeq proteins) that reference a WP_ RefSeq accession.</p>
