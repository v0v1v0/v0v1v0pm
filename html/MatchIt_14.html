<h2>Optimal Full Matching</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In <code>matchit()</code>, setting <code>method = "full"</code> performs optimal full
matching, which is a form of subclassification wherein all units, both
treatment and control (i.e., the "full" sample), are assigned to a subclass
and receive at least one match. The matching is optimal in the sense that
that sum of the absolute distances between the treated and control units in
each subclass is as small as possible. The method relies on and is a wrapper
for <code>optmatch::fullmatch()</code>.
</p>
<p>Advantages of optimal full matching include that the matching order is not
required to be specified, units do not need to be discarded, and it is less
likely that extreme within-subclass distances will be large, unlike with
standard subclassification. The primary output of full matching is a set of
matching weights that can be applied to the matched sample; in this way,
full matching can be seen as a robust alternative to propensity score
weighting, robust in the sense that the propensity score model does not need
to be correct to estimate the treatment effect without bias. Note: with large samples, the optimization may fail or run very slowly; one can try using <code>method = "quick"</code> instead, which also performs full matching but can be much faster.
</p>
<p>This page details the allowable arguments with <code>method = "full"</code>.
See <code>matchit()</code> for an explanation of what each argument means in a general
context and how it can be specified.
</p>
<p>Below is how <code>matchit()</code> is used for optimal full matching:
</p>
<pre>
matchit(formula,
        data = NULL,
        method = "full",
        distance = "glm",
        link = "logit",
        distance.options = list(),
        estimand = "ATT",
        exact = NULL,
        mahvars = NULL,
        anitexact = NULL,
        discard = "none",
        reestimate = FALSE,
        s.weights = NULL,
        caliper = NULL,
        std.caliper = TRUE,
        verbose = FALSE,
        ...)
</pre>

<h4>Mahalanobis Distance Matching</h4>

<p>Mahalanobis distance matching can be done one of two ways:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If no propensity score needs to be estimated, <code>distance</code> should be
set to <code>"mahalanobis"</code>, and Mahalanobis distance matching will occur
using all the variables in <code>formula</code>. Arguments to <code>discard</code> and
<code>mahvars</code> will be ignored, and a caliper can only be placed on named
variables. For example, to perform simple Mahalanobis distance matching, the
following could be run:
</p>
<pre>
matchit(treat ~ X1 + X2, method = "nearest",
        distance = "mahalanobis") </pre>
<p>With this code, the Mahalanobis distance is computed using <code>X1</code> and
<code>X2</code>, and matching occurs on this distance. The <code>distance</code>
component of the <code>matchit()</code> output will be empty.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a propensity score needs to be estimated for any reason, e.g., for
common support with <code>discard</code> or for creating a caliper,
<code>distance</code> should be whatever method is used to estimate the propensity
score or a vector of distance measures, i.e., it should not be
<code>"mahalanobis"</code>. Use <code>mahvars</code> to specify the variables used to
create the Mahalanobis distance. For example, to perform Mahalanobis within
a propensity score caliper, the following could be run:
</p>
<pre>
matchit(treat ~ X1 + X2 + X3, method = "nearest",
        distance =  "glm", caliper = .25,
        mahvars = ~ X1 + X2) </pre>
<p>With this code, <code>X1</code>, <code>X2</code>, and <code>X3</code> are used to estimate the
propensity score (using the <code>"glm"</code> method, which by default is
logistic regression), which is used to create a matching caliper. The actual
matching occurs on the Mahalanobis distance computed only using <code>X1</code>
and <code>X2</code>, which are supplied to <code>mahvars</code>. Units whose propensity
score difference is larger than the caliper will not be paired, and some
treated units may therefore not receive a match. The estimated propensity
scores will be included in the <code>distance</code> component of the
<code>matchit()</code> output. See Examples.

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Outputs</h3>

<p>All outputs described in <code>matchit()</code> are returned with
<code>method = "full"</code> except for <code>match.matrix</code>. This is because
matching strata are not indexed by treated units as they are in some other
forms of matching. When <code>include.obj = TRUE</code> in the call to
<code>matchit()</code>, the output of the call to <code>optmatch::fullmatch()</code> will be
included in the output. When <code>exact</code> is specified, this will be a list
of such objects, one for each stratum of the <code>exact</code> variables.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Calipers can only be used when <code>min.controls</code> is left at its
default.
</p>
<p>The option <code>"optmatch_max_problem_size"</code> is automatically set to
<code>Inf</code> during the matching process, different from its default in
<em>optmatch</em>. This enables matching problems of any size to be run, but
may also let huge, infeasible problems get through and potentially take a
long time or crash R. See <code>optmatch::setMaxProblemSize()</code> for more details.
