<h2>Nearest Neighbor Matching</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In <code>matchit()</code>, setting <code>method = "nearest"</code> performs greedy nearest
neighbor matching. A distance is computed between each treated unit and each
control unit, and, one by one, each treated unit is assigned a control unit
as a match. The matching is "greedy" in the sense that there is no action
taken to optimize an overall criterion; each match is selected without
considering the other matches that may occur subsequently.
</p>
<p>This page details the allowable arguments with <code>method = "nearest"</code>.
See <code>matchit()</code> for an explanation of what each argument means in a general
context and how it can be specified.
</p>
<p>Below is how <code>matchit()</code> is used for nearest neighbor matching:
</p>
<pre>
matchit(formula,
        data = NULL,
        method = "nearest",
        distance = "glm",
        link = "logit",
        distance.options = list(),
        estimand = "ATT",
        exact = NULL,
        mahvars = NULL,
        antiexact = NULL,
        discard = "none",
        reestimate = FALSE,
        s.weights = NULL,
        replace = TRUE,
        m.order = NULL,
        caliper = NULL,
        ratio = 1,
        min.controls = NULL,
        max.controls = NULL,
        verbose = FALSE,
        ...) </pre>

corresponds to matching without replacement (i.e., <code>replace = FALSE</code>),
and setting <code>reuse.max = Inf</code> corresponds to traditional matching with
replacement (i.e., <code>replace = TRUE</code>) with no limit on the number of

<dd>
<p> one or more variables containing a unit ID for each

Omitting this argument is the same as giving each observation a unique ID.
Ignored when <code>replace = TRUE</code>.  </p>

<h4>Mahalanobis Distance Matching</h4>

<p>Mahalanobis distance matching can be done one of two ways:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If no propensity score needs to be estimated, <code>distance</code> should be
set to <code>"mahalanobis"</code>, and Mahalanobis distance matching will occur
using all the variables in <code>formula</code>. Arguments to <code>discard</code> and
<code>mahvars</code> will be ignored, and a caliper can only be placed on named
variables. For example, to perform simple Mahalanobis distance matching, the
following could be run:
</p>
<pre>
matchit(treat ~ X1 + X2, method = "nearest",
        distance = "mahalanobis") </pre>
<p>With this code, the Mahalanobis distance is computed using <code>X1</code> and
<code>X2</code>, and matching occurs on this distance. The <code>distance</code>
component of the <code>matchit()</code> output will be empty.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a propensity score needs to be estimated for any reason, e.g., for
common support with <code>discard</code> or for creating a caliper,
<code>distance</code> should be whatever method is used to estimate the propensity
score or a vector of distance measures. Use <code>mahvars</code> to specify the
variables used to create the Mahalanobis distance. For example, to perform
Mahalanobis within a propensity score caliper, the following could be run:
</p>
<pre>
matchit(treat ~ X1 + X2 + X3, method = "nearest",
        distance = "glm", caliper = .25,
        mahvars = ~ X1 + X2) </pre>
<p>With this code, <code>X1</code>, <code>X2</code>, and <code>X3</code> are used to estimate the
propensity score (using the <code>"glm"</code> method, which by default is
logistic regression), which is used to create a matching caliper. The actual
matching occurs on the Mahalanobis distance computed only using <code>X1</code>
and <code>X2</code>, which are supplied to <code>mahvars</code>. Units whose propensity
score difference is larger than the caliper will not be paired, and some
treated units may therefore not receive a match. The estimated propensity
scores will be included in the <code>distance</code> component of the
<code>matchit()</code> output. See Examples.

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Estimand</h4>

<p>The <code>estimand</code> argument controls whether control units are selected to be
matched with treated units (<code>estimand = "ATT"</code>) or treated units are
selected to be matched with control units (<code>estimand = "ATC"</code>). The
"focal" group (e.g., the treated units for the ATT) is typically made to be
the smaller treatment group, and a warning will be thrown if it is not set
that way unless <code>replace = TRUE</code>. Setting <code>estimand = "ATC"</code> is
equivalent to swapping all treated and control labels for the treatment
variable. When <code>estimand = "ATC"</code>, the default <code>m.order</code> is
<code>"smallest"</code>, and the <code>match.matrix</code> component of the output will
have the names of the control units as the rownames and be filled with the
names of the matched treated units (opposite to when <code>estimand = "ATT"</code>). Note that the argument supplied to <code>estimand</code> doesn't
necessarily correspond to the estimand actually targeted; it is merely a
switch to trigger which treatment group is considered "focal".
</p>



<h4>Variable Ratio Matching</h4>

<p><code>matchit()</code> can perform variable
ratio "extremal" matching as described by Ming and Rosenbaum (2000). This
method tends to result in better balance than fixed ratio matching at the
expense of some precision. When <code>ratio &gt; 1</code>, rather than requiring all
treated units to receive <code>ratio</code> matches, each treated unit is assigned
a value that corresponds to the number of control units they will be matched
to. These values are controlled by the arguments <code>min.controls</code> and
<code>max.controls</code>, which correspond to <code class="reqn">\alpha</code> and <code class="reqn">\beta</code>,
respectively, in Ming and Rosenbaum (2000), and trigger variable ratio
matching to occur. Some treated units will receive <code>min.controls</code>
matches and others will receive <code>max.controls</code> matches (and one unit
may have an intermediate number of matches); how many units are assigned
each number of matches is determined by the algorithm described in Ming and
Rosenbaum (2000, p119). <code>ratio</code> controls how many total control units
will be matched: <code>n1 * ratio</code> control units will be matched, where
<code>n1</code> is the number of treated units, yielding the same total number of
matched controls as fixed ratio matching does.
</p>
<p>Variable ratio matching cannot be used with Mahalanobis distance matching or
when <code>distance</code> is supplied as a matrix. The calculations of the
numbers of control units each treated unit will be matched to occurs without
consideration of <code>caliper</code> or <code>discard</code>. <code>ratio</code> does not
have to be an integer but must be greater than 1 and less than <code>n0/n1</code>,
where <code>n0</code> and <code>n1</code> are the number of control and treated units,
respectively. Setting <code>ratio = n0/n1</code> performs a crude form of full
matching where all control units are matched. If <code>min.controls</code> is not
specified, it is set to 1 by default. <code>min.controls</code> must be less than
<code>ratio</code>, and <code>max.controls</code> must be greater than <code>ratio</code>. See
Examples below for an example of their use.
</p>



<h4>Using <code>m.order = "closest"</code>
</h4>

<p>As of version 4.6.0, <code>m.order</code> can be set to <code>"closest"</code>, which works regardless of how the distance measure is specified. This matches in order of the distance between units. The closest pair of units across all potential pairs of units will be matched first; the second closest pair of all potential pairs will be matched second, etc. This ensures that the best possible matches are given priority, and in that sense performs similarly to <code>m.order = "smallest"</code>.
</p>



<h3>Outputs</h3>

<p>All outputs described in <code>matchit()</code> are returned with
<code>method = "nearest"</code>. When <code>replace = TRUE</code>, the <code>subclass</code>
component is omitted. <code>include.obj</code> is ignored.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Sometimes an error will be produced by <em>Rcpp</em> along the lines of
<code>"function 'Rcpp_precious_remove' not provided by package 'Rcpp'"</code>. It
is not immediately clear why this happens, though
<a href="https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/rcpp-devel/2021-July/010648.html">this</a>
thread appears to provide some insight. In a fresh session, run
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠remove.packages(c("MatchIt", "Rcpp")); install.packages("MatchIt")⁠</code>.
This should sync <em>MatchIt</em> and <em>Rcpp</em> and ensure they work
correctly.
</p>


<h3>References</h3>

<p>In a manuscript, you don't need to cite another package when
using <code>method = "nearest"</code> because the matching is performed completely
within <em>MatchIt</em>. For example, a sentence might read:
</p>
<p><em>Nearest neighbor matching was performed using the MatchIt package (Ho, Imai, King, &amp; Stuart, 2011) in R.</em>
</p>

a call to <code>matchit()</code>.

nearest neighbor matching except that an overall distance criterion is
minimized.
