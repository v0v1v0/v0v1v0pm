<h2>Data from National Supported Work Demonstration and PSID, as analyzed by
Dehejia and Wahba (1999).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a subsample of the data from the treated group in the National
Supported Work Demonstration (NSW) and the comparison sample from the
Population Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID). This data was previously
analyzed extensively by Lalonde (1986) and Dehejia and Wahba (1999).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 614 observations (185 treated, 429 control).
There are 9 variables measured for each individual.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "treat"
is the treatment assignment (1=treated, 0=control).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "age" is age in years.

<li>
<p> "educ" is education in number of years of schooling.
