Lindner Center data on 996 PCI patients analyzed by Kereiakes et al. (2000)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data are adapted from the lindner dataset in the USPS package. The description comes from that package, except for the variable sixMonthSurvive, which is a recode of lifepres
</p>
<p>Data from an observational study of 996 patients receiving an initial Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) at Ohio Heart Health, Christ Hospital, Cincinnati in 1997 and followed for at least 6 months by the staff of the Lindner Center. The patients thought to be more severely diseased were assigned to treatment with abciximab (an expensive, high-molecular-weight IIb/IIIa cascade blocker); in fact, only 298 (29.9 percent) of patients received usual-care-alone with their initial PCI.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("lindner")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 10 variables collected on 996 patients; no NAs.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>lifepres</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Mean life years preserved due to survival for at least 6 months following PCI; numeric value of either 11.4 or 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cardbill</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Cardiac related costs incurred within 6 months of patient's initial PCI; numeric value in 1998 dollars; costs were truncated by death for the 26 patients with lifepres == 0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>abcix</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric treatment selection indicator; 0 implies usual PCI care alone; 1 implies usual PCI care deliberately augmented by either planned or rescue treatment with abciximab.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>stent</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Coronary stent deployment; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>height</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Height in centimeters; numeric integer from 108 to 196.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>female</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Female gender; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>diabetic</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Diabetes mellitus diagnosis; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>acutemi</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Acute myocardial infarction within the previous 7 days; numeric, with 1 meaning YES and 0 meaning NO.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ejecfrac</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Left ejection fraction; numeric value from 0 percent to 90 percent.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ves1proc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of vessels involved in the patient's initial PCI procedure; numeric integer from 0 to 5.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sixMonthSurvive</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Survival at six months - a recoded version of lifepres.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
