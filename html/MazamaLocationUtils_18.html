<h2>Manage Spatial Metadata for Known Locations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A suite of utility functions for discovering and managing
metadata associated with sets of spatially unique "known locations".
</p>
<p>This package is intended to be used in support of data management activities
associated with fixed locations in space. The motivating fields include both
air and water quality monitoring where fixed sensors report at regular time
intervals.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When working with environmental monitoring time series, one of the first things
you have to do is create unique identifiers for each individual time series. In
an ideal world, each environmental time series would have both a
<code>locationID</code> and a <code>deviceID</code> that uniquely identify the specific instrument
making measurements and the physical location where measurements are made. A
unique <code>timeseriesID</code> could
be produced as <code>locationID_deviceID</code>. Metadata associated with each
<code>timeseriesID</code> would contain basic information needed for downstream analysis
including at least:
</p>
<pre>
  timeseriesID, locationID, deviceID, longitude, latitude, ...
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An extended time series for an occasionally re-positioned sensor would group by <code>deviceID</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple sensors placed at a single location could be be grouped by <code>locationID</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maps would be created using <code>longitude, latitude</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time series would be accessed from a secondary <code>data</code> table with <code>timeseriesID</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, we are rarely supplied with a truly unique and truly spatial
<code>locationID</code>. Instead we often use <code>deviceID</code> or an associated non-spatial
identifier as a stand-in for <code>locationID</code>.
</p>
<p>Complications we have seen include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>GPS-reported longitude and latitude can have <em>jitter</em> in the fourth or fifth
decimal place making it challenging to use them to create a unique <code>locationID</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensors are sometimes <em>re-positioned</em> in what the scientist considers the "same
location".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data for a single sensor goes through different processing pipelines using
different identifiers and is later brought together as two separate time series.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The spatial scale of what constitutes a "single location" depends on the
instrumentation and scientific question being asked.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deriving location-based metadata from spatial datasets is computationally
intensive unless saved and identified with a unique <code>locationID</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated searches for spatial metadata occasionally produce incorrect results
because of the non-infinite resolution of spatial datasets.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This package attempts to address all of these issues by maintaining a table
of known locations for which CPU intensive spatial data calculations have
already been performed. While requests to add new locations to the table may
take some time, searches for spatial metadata associated with existing
locations are simple lookups.
</p>
<p>Working in this manner will solve the problems initially mentioned but also
provides further useful functionality.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Administrators can correct entries in the <code>collectionName</code> table.
(<em>e.g.</em> locations in river bends that even high resolution spatial datasets mis-assign)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional, non-automatable metadata can be added to <code>collectionName</code>.
(<em>e.g.</em> commonly used location names within a community of practice)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different field campaigns can have separate <code>collectionName</code> tables.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>.csv</code> or <code>.rda</code> versions of well populated tables can be downloaded from a
URL and used locally, giving scientists working with known locations instant
access to spatial data that otherwise requires special skills, large datasets
and lots of compute cycles.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
