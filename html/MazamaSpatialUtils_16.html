<h3>Note</h3>

<p>From the source documentation:
</p>
<p>The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana,
these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the
equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs,
municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are
delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and
the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia),
there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county
organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These
incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as
equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of
Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an
equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats
the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data
presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American
Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands,
and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States,
Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.
