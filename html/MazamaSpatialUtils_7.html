<h2>Convert Exclusive Economic Zones countries shapefile</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a simple features dataframe for combined EEZ/country boundaries.
</p>
<p>The full resolution file will be named "EEZCountries.rda". In addition,
"_05", _02" and "_01" versions of the file will be created that that are
simplified to 5%, 2% and 1%. Simplified versions will greatly improve the
speed of both searching and plotting.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">convertEEZCountries()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A world EEZ/countries shapefile is converted to a simple features dataframe
with additional columns of data. To use this function, the file
"EEZ_land_union_v3_202003.zip" must be downloaded into the user's spatial
directory which is set with <code>setSpatialDataDir()</code>. The resulting file
will be created in this same spatial data directory.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Name of the datasetName being created.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For polygons with overlapping claims of sovereignty, we arbitrarily
assign the polygon to the country identified in the <code>ISO_SOV1</code> field.

<p>Geographic Information Systems have become indispensable tools in managing
and displaying marine data and information. However, a unique georeferenced
standard of marine place names and areas was not available, hampering several
marine geographic applications, for example the linking of these locations to
databases to integrate data. The purpose of Marine Regions is therefore to
create a standard, relational list of geographic names, coupled with information
and maps of the geographic location of these features. This will improve access
and clarity of the different geographic, marine names such as seas, sandbanks,
ridges and bays and display univocally the boundaries of marine biogeographic
or managerial marine areas.
</p>
<p>Marine Regions is an integration of the VLIMAR Gazetteer and the VLIZ Maritime
Boundaries Geodatabase. The VLIMAR Gazetteer is a database with geographic,
mainly marine names such as seas, sandbanks, seamounts, ridges, bays or even
standard sampling stations used in marine research. The geographic cover of
the VLIMAR gazetteer is global but initially focused on the Belgian Continental
Shelf and the Scheldt Estuary and the Southern Bight of the North Sea. Gradually
more regional and global geographic information was added to VLIMAR and combining
this information with the Maritime Boundaries database, representing the
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the world, led to the creation of marineregions.org.
</p>
<p>Marine Regions is managed by the Flanders Marine Institute. Funding for the
creation of the VLIMAR gazetteer was provided initially through the EU Network
of Excellence MarBEF, but also other European initiatives such as Lifewatch
provide the necessary funding for the maintenance and management of Marine Regions.
</p>
<p>Marine Regions depends on data and knowledge sharing from global, European,
regional and national data providers and relevant experts. By setting up
Collaboration Agreements, data providers will benefit from belonging to the
Marine Regions partnership as they would get increased visibility, gain access
to a variety of data analysis services which will benefit from integration of
several distributed spatial datasetNames, as well as enjoying the benefit of the
creation of stable unique identifiers. An example template of a Collaboration
Agreement can be found here. Please contact info@marineregions.org if your
organisation is interested to explore this collaboration.
