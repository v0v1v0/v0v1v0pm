<h2>Core functionality for environmental time series</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Utility functions for working with environmental time series data from known
locations. The compact data model is structured as a list with two dataframes. A
meta' dataframe contains spatial and measuring device metadata associated with
deployments at known locations. A 'data' dataframe contains a 'datetime' column
followed by columns of measurements associated with each "device-deployment".
