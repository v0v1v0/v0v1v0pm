<h2>Calculates the statistical power of a random effects meta-analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the statistical power of a random effects meta-analysis
based on the methods described by Valentine et al. 2010, J of Educational and Behavioral Studies.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calcMetaPower(es, avg_n, nStudies, hg, tail=2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>es</code></td>
<td>
<p>effect size you're trying to detect (e.g. 0.6)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>avg_n</code></td>
<td>
<p>the average sample size of each GROUP in each STUDY (e.g. 10)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nStudies</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of studies you put in the meta-analysis (aka Discovery cohort) (e.g. 5)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hg</code></td>
<td>
<p>heterogeneity, (".33" for small, "1" for moderate, &amp; "3" for large) (e.g. 0.33)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tail</code></td>
<td>
<p>whether you have a one tail or two tail p-value</p>
</td>
</tr>

</p>
<p><code>avg_n</code> is the average number people in each group in each study, so if you have
4 studies, and each study compared 10 cases and 10 controls, then <code>avg_n</code> = 10. 
</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS CODE DOES NOT TAKE MULTIPLE HYPOTHESIS TESTING INTO ACCOUNT
IT ASSUMES P&lt; 0.05
</p>
<p>For clarity, avg_n is the average number people in each group in each study, so if you have
4 studies, and each study compared 10 cases and 10 controls, then avg_n = 10.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Statistic <code>Power</code> of the random effects meta-analysis described. 
Most statisticians want a statistical power of at least 0.8, which means that there is an 80
that if there is a true effect, you will detect it.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># effect size =0.7
# 10 samples on average in each group in each study
# 5 studies included in meta-analysis
# low heterogeneity (0.33)
calcMetaPower(es=0.7, avg_n=10, nStudies=5, hg=0.33)
</code></pre>
