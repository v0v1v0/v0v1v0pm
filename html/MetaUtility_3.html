<h2>Convert Cohen's d to log risk ratio</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts Cohen's d (computed with a binary X) to a log risk ratio
for use in meta-analysis. Under the assumption that Y is approximately normal, the resulting log risk ratio represents a dichotomization of Y that is near its median and otherwise will  tend to be conservative.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">d_to_logRR(d, se = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>Cohen's d</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se</code></td>
<td>
<p>Standard error of d</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Internally, this function first converts d to a log odds ratio using Chinn's (2000) conversion. The resulting log odds ratio approximates the value that would be obtained if Y were dichotomized; if Y is approximately normal, the log odds ratio is approximately invariant to the choice of threshold at which Y is dichotomized (Chinn, 2000). Then, the function converts the log odds ratio to a log risk ratio using VanderWeele's (2020) square-root conversion. That conversion is conservative in that it allows for the possibility that the dichotomized Y is not rare (i.e., the point of dichotomization is not at an extreme value of Y).
