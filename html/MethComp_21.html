<h2>A MCmcmc object from the hba1c data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This object is included for illustrative purposes. It is a result of a
5-hour run using MCmcmc, with <code>n.iter=100000</code>.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is a <code>MCmcmc</code> object.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are the venous measurements from the <code>hba1c</code> dataset,
using the day of analysis as replicate. Measurements are taken to be linked
within replicate (=day of analysis).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(hba.MC)
attr(hba.MC,"mcmc.par")
# print.MCmcmc(hba.MC)
# One of the chains is really fishy (it's the first one)
# trace.MCmcmc(hba.MC)
# trace.MCmcmc(hba.MC,"beta")
# Try to have a look, excluding the first chain
# hba.MCsub &lt;- subset.MCmcmc(hba.MC,chains=-1)
# trace.MCmcmc(hba.MCsub)
# trace.MCmcmc(hba.MCsub,"beta")
# A MCmcmc object also has class mcmc.list, so we can use the
# coda functions for covergence diagnostics:
# acfplot( subset.MCmcmc(hba.MC, subset="sigma"))
