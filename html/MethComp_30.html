<h2>Measurement of oxygen saturation in blood</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>61 children had their blood oxygen content measured at the Children's
Hospital in Melbourne, either with a chemical method analysing gases in the
blood (<code>CO</code>) or by a pulse oximeter measuring transcutaneously
(<code>pulse</code>). Replicates are linked between methods; i.e. replicate 1 for
each of the two methods are done at the same time. However, replicate
measurements were taken in quick succession so the pairs of measurements are
exchangeable within person.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 354 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>
 <dl>
<dt><code>meth</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Measurement methods, factor with levels
<code>CO</code>, <code>pulse</code></p>
</dd> <dt><code>item</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Id for the child</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>repl</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Replicate of measurements. There were 3 measurements for
most children, 4 had only 2 replicates with each method, one only 1</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>y</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Oxygen saturation in percent.</p>
</dd> </dl>
