<h2>Plot the agreement after recalibration</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function draws the "agreement plot" after recalibration, which is used
to visually appraise the degree of agreement between the new and reference
methods, before recalibration of the new method.
It is obtained by graphing a scatter plot of <code>y1-y2</code> (difference of the methods)
versus the BLUP of the latent trait, <code>x</code>, along with the bias and 95% limits
of agreement with their 95% simultaneous confidence bands.
The function adds a second scale on the right axis, showing the percentage
of agreement index.
