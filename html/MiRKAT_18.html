<h2>Simulated metadata for microbiome regression-based analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simulation code can be seen in ?KRV
Corresponding OTU matrix is stored in "throat.otu.tab"
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(throat.meta)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 59 rows and 16 columns, rows being participants and columns being different covariates to possibly be
accounted for in any utilized linear models.
</p>
<p>throat.meta is part of a microbiome data set for studying the effect of smoking on the upper respiratory tract microbiome. This data set 
comes from the throat microbiome of left body side. It contains 60 subjects consisting of 32 nonsmokers and 28 smokers.
