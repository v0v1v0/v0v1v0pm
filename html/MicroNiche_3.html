<h2>
Feinsinger's proportional similarity index
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This index is a measurement of proportional similarity (PS) of a taxon in relation to an 
environmental parameter, such as pH or temperature. A value of 0 indicates an inverse 
relationship between taxon abundance and the environmental parameter, whilst 1 indicates a 
positive relationship between taxon abundance and the environmental parameter. A value of 
0.5 indicates no relationship.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">feinsingers.PS(df, R, sampleInfo, envInfo, q = 1.65)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix of taxa (rows) by samples (columns) as discrete counts per sample. Col 1 must be
a taxon identifier. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R</code></td>
<td>

<p>The number of different environments being compared.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sampleInfo</code></td>
<td>

<p>A categorical variable identifying which samples correspond to which environment.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>envInfo</code></td>
<td>

<p>A quantitative variable of some environmental parameter measured per sample.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q</code></td>
<td>

<p>A coefficient for the LOQ, set to 1.65. Decreasing or increasing q will affect which taxa
are flagged as being below the LOQ.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Taxon inputs must be as discrete counts across samples, with a taxon identifier in column 1. 
This function also performs null model testing against a distribution of PS generated from 
R random proportions permuted 999 times. This allows the user to perform significance testing 
and to determine a probability that the taxa PS differs from the null PS. The output includes 
each taxon's PS, a P value of significance testing against the null model distribution, and 
a Benjamin-Hochberg adjusted P value to account for false discovery rate. 
</p>
<p>A plot of the null distribution with 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles highlighted as red dotted lines 
is also provided. 
</p>
<p>Finally, this function also calculates the limit of quantification (LOQ) to identify taxa 
whose niche cannot be confidently measured. A plot of log abundance x taxon rank is provided
to visualise the distribution of the data, a fitted lognormal taxa rank model, and the 
LOQ determined based on the standard deviation of the lognormal model.  
</p>
<p>Feinsinger's PS is calculated as follows:
PS[j] = 1 - 0.5*sum(|p[i] - r[i]|)
whereby p[i] is the proportion of taxon j in environment i and r[i] is the proportion of the
environmental parameter in i.
</p>
<p>This function depends on ggplot2 to generate a plot of the null distribution and reshape2
to identify the taxa below the LOQ.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class "data.frame" that gives the PS, P value and adjusted P value for each taxon.
A column noting taxa that fall below the LOQ are identified as T.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The null model testing becomes increasingly robust with increasing R. If R == 2 the results
should be interpreted with caution.
