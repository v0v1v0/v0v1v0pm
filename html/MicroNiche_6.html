<h2>
Levin's niche overlap index
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This index is a measurement of the overlap between pairs of taxa across samples. A value 
of 1 indicates perfect overlap, and 0 indicates no overlap.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">levins.overlap(df, q = 1.65)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix of taxa (rows) by samples (columns) as discrete counts per sample. Col 1 must be
a taxon identifier.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q</code></td>
<td>

<p>A coefficient for the LOQ, set to 1.65. Decreasing or increasing q will affect which taxa
are flagged as being below the LOQ.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Taxon inputs must be as discrete counts across samples, with a taxon identifier in column 1.  
The output is a matrix of paired taxon overlap indices. Specifically, Levin's Overlap (LO) 
indices of LO[1,2] are rows and LO[2,1] are columns, for taxa 1 and 2. 
</p>
<p>Levin's overlap is calculated as follows:
LO[i,j] = sum(p[i]*p[j])/sum(p[i]^2)
whereby p[i] is the proportion of taxon i per sample and p[j] is the proportion of taxon j
per sample. 
</p>
<p>Taxa below the LOQ are flagged with an asterisk.
</p>
<p>This function depends on reshape2 to produce a matrix of overlap comparisons.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class "data.frame" that gives LO[1,2] as rows and LO[2,1] as columns.
</p>
