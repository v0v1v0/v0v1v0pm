<h2>
Proportional similarity overlap index
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This index is a measurement of the overlap of proportional similarity (PS) indices between 
pairs of taxa across samples. As the PS is a niche breadth index that measures the similarity
between a taxon's distribution and an environmental parameter, the PS overlap also considers
environmental information. A value of 1 indicates perfect overlap, and 0 indicates no overlap. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">proportional.overlap(df, sampleInfo, envInfo, q = 1.65)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix of taxa (rows) by samples (columns) as discrete counts per sample. Col 1 must be
a taxon identifier.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sampleInfo</code></td>
<td>

<p>A categorical variable identifying which samples correspond to which environment.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>envInfo</code></td>
<td>

<p>A quantitative variable of some environmental parameter measured per sample.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>q</code></td>
<td>

<p>A coefficient for the LOQ, set to 1.65. Decreasing or increasing q will affect which taxa
are flagged as being below the LOQ.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Taxon inputs must be as discrete counts across samples, with a taxon identifier in column 1. 
The output is a matrix of paired taxon overlap indices. Specifically, Proportional Overlap 
(PO) indices of PO[1,2] are rows and PO[2,1] are columns, for taxa 1 and 2, however these 
values are identical. Feinsinger's PS is calculated as per feinsingers.PS. 
</p>
<p>Proportional overlap is calculated as follows:
PO[i,j] = 1 - (|PS[i] - PS[j]|)/(PS[i] + PS[j])
whereby PS[i] is the PS of taxon i and PS[j] is the PS of taxon j. 
</p>
<p>Taxa below the LOQ are flagged with an asterisk.
</p>
<p>This function depends on reshape2 to produce a matrix of overlap comparisons.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class "data.frame" that gives PO[1,2] as rows and PO[2,1] as columns.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>
