<h2>MigConnectivity: A package for quantifying migratory connectivity pattern and
strength for migratory animals</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The MigConnectivity package allows the user to estimate or calculate
transition probabilities for migratory animals between any two phases of the
annual cycle, using a variety of different data types, with the function
<code>estTransition</code>. The user can also estimate or calculate the
strength of migratory connectivity (MC), a standardized metric to quantify
the extent to which populations co-occur between two phases of the annual
cycle. MC is independent of data type and accounts for the relative abundance
of populations distributed across a seasonal range. The package includes
functions to estimate MC (<code>estStrength</code>) and the more traditional
metric of migratory connectivity strength (Mantel correlation; rM;
<code>estMantel</code>) incorporating uncertainty from multiple
sources of sampling error. Description of the MC metric can be found in Cohen
et al. (2018).

<h3>Key MigConnectivity Functions</h3>

<p><code>estTransition</code>: Estimate psi (transition probabilities between
locations in two phases of the annual cycle)
</p>
<p><code>estStrength</code>: Estimate MC, migratory connectivity strength
