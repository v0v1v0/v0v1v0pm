<h2>Ovenbird light-level geolocator and GPS necessary data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Ovenbird data from Cohen et al. (2018) and Hallworth and Marra (2015).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">OVENdata
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A named list with the necessary data to replicate the analyses
found in Cohen et al. (2018) with archival light-level geolocator and
GPS data.
The data contained in the list are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> geo.bias: Archival light-level geolocator bias estimates.
Location bias estimates in light-level geolocator estimates calculated
using birds captured at known locations in Florida, Jamaica and Puerto Rico.
Location bias is reported in meters and is a vector of length two with bias
estimates in geolocator locations.
Format: A vector of length two with bias estimates in geolocator locations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> geo.vcov: Covariance estimates in light-level geolocator estimates calculated
using birds captured at known locations in Florida, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico.
Covariance is reported in meters.
Format:  A 2x2 matrix of covariance estimates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> isGL: Archival light-level geolocator or PinPoint-10 GPS tag
<code>logical</code> vector indicating whether location estimates were obtained with a
light-level geolocator (<code>TRUE</code>) or PinPoint-10 GPS tag (<code>FALSE</code>).
Format:  <code>logical</code> of length 39
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> targetPoints: Non-breeding locations for 39 Ovenbirds caught during the breeding
season who carried either a light-level geolocator or PinPoint-10 GPS tag.
Ovenbirds were captured at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH and Jug Bay Wetland
Sanctuary, MD. These data are used as <code>originPoints</code> in the <code>estMC</code> function.
<code>coords.x1</code> and <code>coords.x2</code> represent the longitude and latitude of the
capture sites, respectively. The data are projected in Lambert Conformal Conic.
Format:  <code>SpatialPoints</code>
"+proj=aea +lat_1=20 +lat_2=60 +lat_0=40 +lon_0=-96 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80

<p> originPoints: Capture locations for 39 Ovenbirds caught during the breeding season
who carried either a light-level geolocator or PinPoint-10 GPS tag. Ovenbirds were
captured at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH and Jug Bay Wetland Sanctuary, MD.
These data are used as <code>originPoints</code> in the <code>estMC</code> function. <code>coords.x1</code>
and <code>coords.x2</code> represent the longitude and latitude of the capture sites, respectively.
The data are projected in Lambert Conformal Conic.
Format:  <code>SpatialPoints</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> targetSites: Non-breeding distribution target sites used in Cohen et al. (in prep) to
estimate MC of Ovenbirds tracked with light-level geolocators and PinPoint-10 GPS tags.
There are three non-breeding target sites 1) Florida, United States, 2) Cuba, and 3) Hispaniola
(Dominican Republic and Haiti).
Format:  <code>SpatialPolygons</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> originSites: Breeding distribution origin sites used in Cohen et al. (in prep) to estimate
MC of Ovenbirds tracked with light-level geolocators and PinPoint-10 GPS tags. There are two breeding
origin sites, one that encompasses NH and another that encompasses MD capture deployment locations.
Format: <code>SpatialPolygons</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> originRelAbund: A dataset containing relative abundance estimates from BBS data reported in Cohen et al.
(in prep). These estimates can be used in <code>estMC</code> function as <code>originRelAbund</code> in conjunction
with archival light-level geolocator and GPS locations.
Format: A vector of length two with relative abundance estimates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> originDist: The pairwise Great Circle Distance between the center of the polygons contained within
<code>originSites</code>. See "Ovenbird breeding distribution origin sites" or <code>originSites</code>.
Format: square distance matrix
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> targetDist: The pairwise Great Circle Distance between the center of the polygons contained within
<code>targetSites</code>. See "Ovenbird non-breeding distribution target sites" or <code>targetSites</code>.
Format: square distance matrix
