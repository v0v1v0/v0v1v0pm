<h2>Example transition probabilities (psis) between origin and target sites</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing example psi matrices used in Cohen et al. (2018).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">samplePsis
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A named list with 8 transition probability matrices in it. The
direction is from origin site (rows) to target sites (columns), so each
row of each matrix sums to 1.  The psi matrices are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Full Mix: Full mixing from all origin sites to all target sites
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Avoid One Site: All origin sites have the same transition
probabilities, mostly avoiding target site 4
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Full Connectivity: Each origin site transitions to only one target
site
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Half Mix: Origin sites A and B mix fully between target sites 1 and
2, but don't move to target sites 3 or 4, while origin sites C and D
mix fully between target sites 3 and 4, but don't move to target sites
1 or 2
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Low: Simulation scenario labelled "Moderate Connectivity" in Cohen
et al. (2014)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Medium: Simulation scenario labelled "Strong Connectivity" in Cohen
et al. (2014)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> One Site Preference: Three origin sites have full mixing, but origin
site D only goes to target site 4
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Negative: Artificial transition probability scenario developed to
produce a negative MC value under some circumstances
</p>
</li>
</ul>
