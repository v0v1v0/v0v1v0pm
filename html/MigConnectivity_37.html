<h2>Example origin and target site positions and distances on a 2-D plane</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>sampleOriginPos</code> is a dataset containing example origin site positions
from 12 scenarios used in Cohen et al. (2018).  For the same 12
scenarios, <code>sampleOriginDist</code> contains the origin site distances,
<code>sampleTargetPos</code> contains the target site positions, and
<code>sampleTargetDist</code> contains the target site distances.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Each dataset is a named list with 12 matrices in it, representing 12
scenarios. The position matrices each have 2 columns (x and y position) and
4 rows (for each origin or target site).  The distance matrices are
symmetrical and 4 x 4. The 12 scenarios are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Linear: Both origin and target sites arranged in horizontal linear
fashion, with equal distances between each adjacent site
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> B Dist BC*2: Linear, but the central origin sites are twice as far
from each other as the edge sites are from the adjacent origin sites
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> B Dist BC/2: Linear, but the central origin sites are half as far
from each other as the edge sites are from the adjacent origin sites
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> B Dist CD*2: Linear, but the last two origin sites are twice as far
from each other as the other adjacent origin sites
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> B Dist CD/2: Linear, but the last two origin sites are half as far
from each other as the other adjacent origin sites
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> B Grid: Origin sites arranged on a grid, target sites arranged
linearly, both with all adjacent sites (excluding diagonals)
equidistant
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NB Dist 23*2: Linear, but the central target sites are twice as far
from each other as the edge sites are from the adjacent target sites
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NB Dist 23/2: Linear, but the central target sites are half as far
from each other as the edge sites are from the adjacent target sites
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NB Dist 34*2: Linear, but the last two target sites are twice as far
from each other as the other adjacent target sites
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NB Dist 34/2: Linear, but the last two target sites are half as far
from each other as the other adjacent target sites
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> NB Grid: Target sites arranged on a grid, origin sites arranged
linearly, both with all adjacent sites (excluding diagonals)

</li>
<li>
<p> B/NB Grid: Origin and target sites each arranged on a grid, both
with all adjacent sites (excluding diagonals) equidistant
