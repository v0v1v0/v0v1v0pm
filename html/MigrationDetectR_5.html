<h2>MigrationDetectR: Segment-Based Migration Detection Algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implementation of Migration detection algorithm,
published by Chi et al. (2020) in <em>A general approach to detecting migration events in digital trace data</em> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239408">doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0239408</a> )
</p>


<h3>Changes in the R implementation</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> Compared to the reference, this implementation works at the precision of seconds rather than days.
At the expense of speed, it is applicable at finer timescales.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The segment detector has the additional option to allow for one of several overlapping segments to persist if it contains the majority of occurrences during the overlap period.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>First, transform your data into the format required by the package: Two aligned vectors, one with locations and one with timestamps.
Use the detect_segments function to identify segments of continuous residence.
Then, use the identify_migrations function on the segments to detect migrations.
To optionally determine the best split time, pass the original locations and timestamps vectors.
