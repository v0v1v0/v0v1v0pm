<h2>Data from tactile discrimination task - (Dallmann et al., 2015).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the response recorded from a tactile discrimination task (nine participants). In a
forced-choice experiment, participants were required to discriminate the motion speed of a moving surface by
touching it. Simultaneously with the motion stimulus, a 32Hz masking vibration occurred in half of the trials.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(vibro_exp3)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 126 rows (14 observations x 9 participants) and 5 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>speed</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric, speed of the moving surface (in cm/s, range <code>c(1,16)</code>)</p>
</dd>
<dt>vibration</dt>
<dd>
<p>factor representing the vibration frequency of the masking stimulus. Two levels: 32 (vibration in the experimental condition, in Hz) 
or 0 (no vibration - control condition)</p>
</dd>
<dt>faster</dt>
<dd>
<p>proportion of trials in which the comparison stimulus was judged as faster than the reference</p>
</dd>
<dt>slower</dt>
<dd>
<p>proportion of trials in which the comparison stimulus was judged as slower than the reference</p>
</dd>
<dt>subject</dt>
<dd>
<p>participant's identification code</p>
</dd>
</dl>
