<h2>Summarized Overlap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute summarized overlap on a given overlap (symmetric) matrix.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  summarized.overlap(overlap.mat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlap.mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>an overlap (symmetric) matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>overlap.mat</code> is a <code>p * p</code> matrix containing pair wised overlaps
of <code>p</code> experiments. <code>overlap.mat</code> is assumed a symmetric matrix.
This function returns a summarized overlap based on the input
<code>overlap.mat</code> that charactorizes the overall overlap behavior of the
<code>p</code> experiments.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A single value is returned.
