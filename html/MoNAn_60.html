<h2>Example Data for the MoNAn Package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are example data for the MoNAn package and can be used to estimate a
mobility network. The raw example data is synthetic (i.e., made up).
This fictitious example contains 17 organisations representing
a labour market that are located in two regions (north and south).
742 workers are employed in these organisations at two time-points.
Some are mobile while others work in the same organisation at both time-points.
The following objects are provided for this purpose:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>mobilityEdgelist</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The data frame indicates the origin at time 1
(first column) and the destination at time 2 (second column) for
each of the 742 individuals between the 17 organisations. Note that some
workers stay in their organisation, i.e. their origin equals their
destination.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>orgRegion</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical characteristic describing whether the
organisation is located on the northern (1) or southern (0) region.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>orgSize</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Continuous measure representing the size of each
organisation based on assets and revenue.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>indSex</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Individual-level characteristics representing sex.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
