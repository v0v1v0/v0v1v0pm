<h2>MullerPlot: A package for generating Muller plot from population/abundance/frequency dynamics and
parental/geneaolgy/phylogeny relation.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package generates Muller plot from parental/genealogy/phylogeny relation and
population/abundance/frequency dynamics. Muller plots are plots which combine information about
succession of different OTUs (genotypes, phenotypes, species, ...) and information about dynamics
of their abundances (populations or frequencies) over time. They are powerful and fascinating
tools to visualize evolutionary dynamics. They may be employed also in study of diversity and
its dynamics, i.e. how diversity emerges and how changes over time. They called Muller plots
in honor of Hermann Joseph Muller which used them to explain his idea of Muller's ratchet
(H.J. Muller, The American Naturalist 66.703 (1932): 118-138).
</p>
<p>A big difference between Muller plots and normal box plots of abundances is that a Muller plot
depicts not only the relative abundances but also succession of OTUs based on their
genealogy/phylogeny/parental relation. In a Muller plot, horizontal axis is time/generations
and vertical axis represents relative abundances of OTUs at the corresponding times/generations.
Different OTUs are usually shown with polygons with different colors and each OTU originates
somewhere in the middle of its parent area in order to illustrate their succession in evolutionary
process.
</p>
<p>To generate a Muller plot one needs the genealogy/phylogeny/parental relation of OTUs and
their abundances over time.
</p>
<p>MullerPlot package has the tools to generate Muller plots which clearly depict the origin of
successors of OTUs.
