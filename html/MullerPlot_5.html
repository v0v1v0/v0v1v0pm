<h2>Population/Abundance data of OTUs over time for "table" method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data is a small artificial data which contains information about population/abundance of
some artificial OTUs. When data.method in Muller.plot function is "table" then population.data
must be a matrix or data frame with N rows and T columns, which N is the number of OTUs and T
is the number of time steps or generations with provided abundances (or the number of samples). Here
N=8 and T=101.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(PopulationDataTable)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A matrix with 101 columns and 8 rows.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>"rownames" of this matrix/data frame must be OTU names:
</p>
<p>"RBL636","rkd D5891 bcc","ylnC-48","iglK f12","BAeR G11","nuhj-25","HwrK-41","QecF*22"
</p>
<p>and "colnames" must be time steps or generations.
</p>
<p>The Matrix contains abundance of each OTU at each time step.
