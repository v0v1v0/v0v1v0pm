<h2>Filters a matrix of readouts for IS that have a minimum occurrence in some

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Filters a matrix of readouts for IS that have a minimum occurrence in some
measurement
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">filter_at_tp_min(data, at = "168", min = 0.02)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>The readout matrix to filter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>at</code></td>
<td>
<p>A filter for the columns/measurements. Only matching
columns/measurements are considered, though all will be returned.
This is a regular expression, so multiple columns/measurements may
match it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum with which an IS has to occur. This could be either
absolute or relative reads. If 'at' matches multiple
columns/measurements, the 'rowSum()' over the columns will be
used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with only the IS that occur with a minimum at the
selected measurements.
