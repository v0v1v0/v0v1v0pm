<h2>Simultaneous Confidence Intervals for Multinomial Proportions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial proportions, calculated according 
to the method of Sison and Glaz
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">multinomialCI(x, alpha, verbose = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of positive integers representing the number of occurrences of each class. 
The total number of samples equals the sum of such elements.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>The significance level for the confidence intervals. Must be a real number 
in the interval [0, 1].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean flag indicating whether details should be printed to screen 
during the execution of the method. Defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Given a vector of observations with the number of samples falling in each class of a 
multinomial distribution, this function builds simultaneous confidence intervals for the 
multinomial probabilities according to the method proposed by Sison and Glaz (1995). 
The R code has been translated from the SAS code written by May and Johnson (2000).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A k x 2 real matrix, with k being the number of classes, which matches the 
length of the input vector x. Row iof the matrix contains the lower bound (first column) 
and upper bound (second column) defining the confidence interval for the probability 
of the i-th class, which corresponds to the i-th position of the input vector.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Multinomial distribution with 3 classes, from which 79 samples 
# were drawn: 23 of them belong to the first class, 12 to the 
# second class and 44 to the third class. Punctual estimations 
# of the probabilities from this sample would be 23/79, 12/79 
# and 44/79 but we want to build 95% simultaneous confidence intervals 
# for the true probabilities
m = multinomialCI(c(23,12,44), 0.05)
print(paste("First class: [", m[1,1], m[1,2], "]"))
print(paste("Second class: [", m[2,1], m[2,2], "]"))
print(paste("Third class: [", m[3,1], m[3,2], "]"))
