<h2>Splitting Criteria of all the nodes of the tree</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Stores the Splitting criteria of all the nodes of a tree in a list
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">split_node(X, Y, m_feature, Index, i, model, min_leaf, Inv_Cov_Y, Command)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>Input Training matrix of size M x N, M is the number of training samples and N is the number of features</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Output Training response of size M x T, M is the number of samples and T is the number of output responses</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m_feature</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of randomly selected features considered for a split in each regression tree node</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Index</code></td>
<td>
<p>Index of training samples</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>i</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of split. Used as an index, which indicates where in the list the splitting
criteria of this split will be stored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of lists with the spliting criteria of all the node splits. In each iteration,
a new list is included with the spliting criteria of the new split of a node.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min_leaf</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum number of samples in the leaf node. If a node has less than or, equal to min_leaf samples,
then there will be no splitting in that node and the node is a leaf node. Valid input is a positive integer and less than or equal to M (number of training samples)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Inv_Cov_Y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Inverse of Covariance matrix of Output Response matrix for MRF(Give Zero for RF)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Command</code></td>
<td>
<p>1 for univariate Regression Tree (corresponding to RF) and 2 for Multivariate Regression Tree (corresponding to MRF)</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calculates the splitting criteria of a node and stores the information in a list format.
If the node is a parent node, then indices of left and right nodes and feature number and threshold value
of the feature for the split are stored. If the node is a leaf, the output feature matrix of the samples
for the node are stored as a list.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Model: A list of lists with the splitting criteria of all the split of the nodes. In each iteration, the Model is
updated with a new list that includes the splitting criteria of the new split of a node.
