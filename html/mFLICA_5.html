<h2>getFactions function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>getFactions is a support function for inferring faction leaders and their members as well as a faction size ratio of each faction.
Leaders are nodes that have zero outgoing degree. Members of leader A's faction are nodes that have some directed path to A in a following network.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getFactions(adjMat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>adjMat</code></td>
<td>
<p>is an adjacency matrix of a following network.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a list of leader IDs, a list of faction members, and network densities of factions.
</p>

<td>
<p> is a list of faction leader IDs  </p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>factionMembers</code></td>
<td>
<p> is a list of members of factions where <code>factionMembers[[i]]</code> is a list of faction members of a leader <code>leaders[i]</code>'s faction. </p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>factionSizeRatio</code></td>
<td>
<p> is a vector of faction size ratio of each faction.
<code>factionSizeRatio[i]</code> is a number of edges within a leader <code>leaders[i]</code>'s faction divided by N choose 2 where N is a number of all nodes.</p>
