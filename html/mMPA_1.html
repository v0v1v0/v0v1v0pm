<h2>Number of Assays Needed using Mini-Pooling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function <code>minipool(...)</code> calculates the number of assays required, when
using mini-pooling, for
pools that are formed following the order that individual samples appear in the data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">minipool(v, K = 5, vf_cut = 1000, lod = 0, msg = T)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>v</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of non-negative numerical assay results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>
<p>Pool size; default is <code>K = 5</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vf_cut</code></td>
<td>
<p>Cutoff value for defining positive cases;
default is <code>vf_cut = 1000</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lod</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of lower limits of detection or a scalar if the limits are the
same; default is <code>lod = 0</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>msg</code></td>
<td>
<p>Message generated during calculation; default is <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Suppose that N samples are collected for pooled testing. The first
<code>K</code> samples are combined to
form a pool, the next <code>K</code> samples are combined to form the second
pool, and so on. If the number of samples for the last pool is less than
<code>K</code>, these remaining samples are not used to form a pool (i.e.
not included in the calculation). Therefore, a total of
<code>N%/%K</code> pools are formed. The function calculates the number of
assays needed for each of these pools. For mini-pooling, if a pool is
negative, no further tests are needed and all samples in the pool
are concluded as being negative; so the total number of
assays required is one. Otherwise if the pool is tested positive, all
individual samples in the pool are tested and the total number of assays
required is <code>(K + 1)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vectorof length <code>N%/%K</code> for the numbers of assays needed for all pools
that are formed.
