<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Multiple Administrations Adaptive Testing
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><b>maat</b> package is based on the assessment framework involving multiple
tests administered throughout the year using multiple item pools vertically
scaled and multiple phases (stages) of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) 
within each test allowing for transitioning from one item pool (and associated 
constraints) to another between phases as determined necessary by a selected 
transition policy to enhance the quality of measurement.
</p>
<p>The current version of <b>maat</b> supports three administrations (Fall, Winter,
and Spring) with two phases within each administration (Phase 1 and Phase 2),
for six modules in total administered over the course of a year.
</p>
<p>Within each administration, students begin Phase 1 at the grade of record.
One exception to this is that if a student's final <code class="reqn">\theta</code> from the
previous administration was above the 'advanced achievement' cut score of
the grade of record, then the student begins Phase 1 of the following
administration in an above-grade item pool. For example, if a Grade 3
student's final <code class="reqn">\theta</code> from the Fall administration was
<code class="reqn">\theta = 1.1</code> and the 'advanced achievement' cut score for Grade 3 was
<code class="reqn">\theta = 1.0</code>, then the student begins Phase 1 of the Winter
administration in a Grade 4 item pool.
</p>
<p>Within each administration, at the completion of Phase 1, business rules are
used to determine whether a student is routed to an on-grade or off-grade
item pool in Phase 2.
</p>
<p>Detailed descriptions of the assessment design are available in the vignette.
