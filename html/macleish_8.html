<h2>Weather data from Macleish Field Stations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Weather data collected at the Macleish Field Station in Whately,
MA during 2015.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">whately_2015

orchard_2015
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>For both, a data frame (<code>dplyr::tbl_df()</code>) with roughly 52,560 rows and 8 or 9 variables.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Macleish Field Station is a remote outpost owned by Smith
College and used for field research. There are two weather stations on the
premises. One is called <code>WhatelyMet</code> and the other is <code>OrchardMet</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>WhatelyMet</code> station is located at (42.448470, -72.680553) and
the <code>OrchardMet</code> station is at (42.449653, -72.680315).
</p>
<p><code>WhatelyMet</code> is located at the end of Poplar Hill Road in Whately,
Massachusetts, USA. The meteorological instruments of <code>WhatelyMet</code> (except the
rain gauge) are mounted at the top of a tower 25.3 m tall, well above the
surrounding forest canopy. The tower is located on a local ridge at an
elevation 250.75m above sea level.
</p>
<p><code>OrchardMet</code> is located about 250 m north of the first tower in an open
field next to an apple orchard. Full canopy trees (~20 m tall) are within
30 m of this station. This station has a standard instrument configuration
with temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and barometric
pressure measured between 1.5 and 2.0 m above the ground. Wind speed and
direction are measured on a 10 m tall tower and precipitation is measured
on the ground. Ground temperature is measured at 15 and 30 cm below the
ground surface 2 m south of the tower. The tower is located 258.1 m above
sea level. Data collection at OrchardMet began on June 27th, 2014.
</p>
<p>The variables shown above are weather data collected at <code>WhatelyMet</code> and
<code>OrchardMet</code> during 2015. Solar radiation is measured in two different ways:
see <code>SlrW_Avg</code>or the <code>PAR</code> variables for Photosynthetic Active Radiation.
</p>
<p>Note that a loose wire resulted in erroneous temperature reading at OrchardMet
in late November, 2015.
