<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the values of bioclimatic indices used in forest-steppe models with different theoretical
backgrounds, and estimates the presence/absence of 'forest-steppe' ecotone, for a given geographical location
(latitude and elevation) and year/epoch, by using the monthly time series of climate variables.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Here, three forest-steppe models with different theoretical backgrounds are implemented:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>fsp_hlz</code>: A modified variant of the widely used Holdridge life zone (HLZ) system (see for the
basic concept Holdridge 1947, 1967; for a proposed variant Szelepcsényi et al. 2014).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fsp_fai</code>: A clarified version of the forestry climate classification (see for the basic concept
Führer et al. 2011; for a proposed variant Mátyás et al. 2018)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fsp_svm</code>: An initial version of the Siberian Vegetation Model (see Monserud et al. 1993)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The HLZ system classifies the vegetation type based on the distance from the ideal (theoretical) point in the
3-dimensional space of the following bioclimatic indices:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>abt</code>: Mean Annual Biotemperature (Eq 1 in Szelepcsényi et al. (2014); in °C)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tap</code>: Total Annual Precipitation (in mm)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>per</code>: Potential Evapotranspiration Ratio (Eq 4 in Szelepcsényi et al. (2014); dimensionless)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The plotting of thresholds of the above-mentioned bioclimatic indices in the HLZ chart leads to emerge a set
of hexagons and triangles. The hexagons indicate the so-called core HLZ types, while the so-called
transitional HLZ types are circumscribed by equilateral triangles in the HLZ chart (see Szelepcsényi et al.
2014). However, in contrast to this study, here, the transitional types are defined as separate zones
designated by the centres of the triangles. As a result, hexagons appear around the triangles in the HLZ
chart, and in parallel, the size of the hexagons denoting the core types also decreases. Thus, the size of the
core and transitional types are the same in this approach. During the classification, all forest-steppe types
designated by Szelepcsényi et al. (2014) (and redefined by us) are aggregated into one class. <br>
The forestry climate classification developed by Führer et al. (2011) was reworked by Mátyás et al. (2018). In
the context of assessing the effects of future climate change, the 'forest-steppe' climate class was
introduced in the model. In the work of Mátyás et al. (2018), this type is characterized by the Forestry
Aridity Index (<code>fai</code>, dimensionless) values between 7.25 and 8. This definition is used here. <br>
The Siberian Vegetation Model (Monserud et al. 1993) defines numerous types of forest-steppe on the basis of
values of the Growing Degree-Days above 5°C (<code>gdd5</code>, in °C day), the Budyko's Dryness Index
(<code>bdi</code>, dimensionless), and the Condrad's Continentality Index (<code>cci</code>, in per cent). Here, all
such ecotone types are aggregated into one class, in order to estimate the presence/absence of the
‘forest-steppe’ ecotone.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Depending on the setting, a data frame with three or more columns where the presence/absence data are
stored in the last three columns labelled <code>'fsp_hlz'</code>, <code>'fsp_fai'</code> and <code>'fsp_svm'</code>, while the
additional columns contain the values of bioclimatic indices used. If <code>verbose = FALSE</code>, the return
object is a two- or three-column data frame with the presence/absence data, depending on the available data.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>As with any function with a point mode, a set of basic input data is defined here. In this case, they are as
follows: <code>'temp'</code> (one-year time series of monthly mean air temperature), <code>'prec'</code> (one-year time
series of monthly precipitation sum), and <code>'bsdf'</code> (one-year time series of monthly mean relative
sunshine duration). The objects <code>'temp'</code>, <code>'prec'</code> and <code>'bsdf'</code> must be either vectors of
length 12 or 12-column matrices. The first dimensions of these matrices have to be the same length. The
function automatically converts vectors into single-row matrices during the error handling, and then uses these
matrices. The first dimensions of these matrices determines the number of rows in the result matrix. In the
case of arguments that do not affect the course of the calculation procedure or the structure of the return
object, scalar values (i.e., 'numeric' vector of length 1) may also be allowed. In this case, they are as
follows: <code>'lat'</code> (latitude coordinates in decimal degrees), <code>'elv'</code> (elevation in meters above sea
level), and <code>'year'</code> (year using astronomical year numbering). These scalars are converted to vectors by
the function during the error handling, and these vectors are applied in the further calculations. If these
data are stored in vectors of length at least 2, their length must be the same size of first dimension of the
matrices containing the basic data.
