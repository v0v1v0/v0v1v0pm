<h2>Weekly Fama French 3 Factor Returns</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The weekly returns of the 3 Fama French Factors: Market, the cap factor SMB, 
and the growth factor HML.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wff3
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> object with 4800 observations and 5 columns.
The data run from July, 1926 through June, 2018.
As in the upstream source, the data are given in <em>percents</em>, meaning a
value of 1.00 corresponds to a 1% movement.
Note also that returns presumably are ‘simple’ returns, not log
returns, though this is not clarified by the upstream source.
The columns are defined as follows:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Date</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The closing data, as a <code>Date</code> object. These are typically Saturdays.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Mkt</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The Market weekly return. Note that the risk free rate has been added back
to the excess returns published by the upstream source.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SMB</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The cap factor weekly return.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>HML</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The growth factor weekly return.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>RF</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The risk-free rate, presumably as an weekly rate, though note that no corrections have been
made for weekend effects when adding the risk-free rate back to the market
rate.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
