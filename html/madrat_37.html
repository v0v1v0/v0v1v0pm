<h2>May All Data be Reproducible And Transparent (madrat) *</h2>

It provides functionality such as automatic meta data creation and management, rudimentary quality management, 
data caching, work-flow management an data aggregation.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>* The title is a wish not a promise. By no means we expect this package to deliver everything what is needed to
achieve full reproducibility and transparency, but we believe that it supports efforts in this direction.
