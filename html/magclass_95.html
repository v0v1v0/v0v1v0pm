<h2>magpie_expand</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Expands a MAgPIE object based on a reference
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">magpie_expand(x, ref)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>MAgPIE object that should be expanded</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ref</code></td>
<td>
<p>MAgPIE object that serves as a reference</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Expansion means here that the dimensions of x are expanded accordingly to
ref. Please note that this is really only about expansion. In the case that
one dimension of ref is smaller than of x nothing happens with this
dimension. At the moment magpie_expand is only internally available in the
magclass library
</p>
<p>You can influence the verbosity of this function by setting the option
"magclass.verbosity". By default verbosity is set to 1 which means that
only warnings are returned. Setting verbosity to 2 means that warnings
as well as additional notes are returned. This is done by
options(verbosity.level=2)
</p>
<p>With version 5 of the package magpie_expand has been updated to a newer version
(currently 2.1) and since version 6 this is the only currently supported
version. To switch to the old setup you have to install magclass  in a version &lt; 6
and set <code>options(magclass_expand_version=1)</code>.
</p>
<p>By default expansion is based on the elements in a dimension ignoring the set name of
the dimension. To expand based on set names instead of contents (recommended) you can
switch <code>options(magclass_setMatching=TRUE)</code>. Please be careful with this setting
as it alters the behavior of magclass objects quite significantly! For more information
have a look at <code>vignette("magclass-expansion")</code>.
