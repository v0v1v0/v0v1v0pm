<h2>Concerts synthetic network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Synthetic data matrix of dimension n x d, recording attendances of n=500 people to d=14 concerts from 14 different artists. There are three clusters in the data, each one corresponding to a community of fans of a specific musical genre. Overlaps of these fandoms point towards attendances dictated by artists playing music from sub-genres - such as electropop.
