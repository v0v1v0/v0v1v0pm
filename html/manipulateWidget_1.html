<h2>Add even more interactivity to interactive charts</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is largely inspired by the <code>manipulate</code> package from
Rstudio. It can be used to easily create graphical interface that let the
user modify the data or the parameters of an interactive chart. It also
provides the <code>combineWidgets</code> function to easily combine multiple
interactive charts in a single view.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>manipulateWidget</code> is the main function of the package. It
accepts an expression that generates an interactive chart (and more precisely
an <code>htmlwidget</code> object. See <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/">http://www.htmlwidgets.org/</a> if you
have never heard about it) and a set of controls created with functions
<code>mwSlider</code>, <code>mwCheckbox</code>... which are used to dynamically change
values within the expression. Each time the user modifies the value of a
control, the expression is evaluated again and the chart is updated. Consider
the following code:
</p>
<p><code>manipulateWidget(myPlotFun(country), country = mwSelect(c("BE", "DE", "ES", "FR")))</code>
</p>
<p>It will generate a graphical interface with a select input on its left with
options "BE", "DE", "ES", "FR". By default, at the beginning the value of the
variable <code>country</code> will be equal to the first choice of the
corresponding input. So the function will first execute
<code>myPlotFun("BE")</code> and the result will be displayed in the main panel of
the interface. If the user changes the value to "FR", then the expression
<code>myPlotFun("FR")</code> is evaluated and the new result is displayed.
</p>
<p>The interface also contains a button "Done". When the user clicks on it, the
last chart is returned. It can be stored in a variable, be modified by the
user, saved as a html file with <code>saveWidget</code> from package
<code>htmlwidgets</code> or converted to a static image file with package
<code>webshot</code>.
</p>
<p>Finally one can easily create complex layouts thanks to function
<code>combineWidgets</code>. For instance, assume we want to see a map that
displays values of some variable for a given year, but on its right side we also
want to see the distributions of three variables. Then we could write:
</p>
<pre>
myPlotFun &lt;- function(year, variable) {
  combineWidgets(
    ncol = 2, colSize = c(3, 1),
    myMap(year, variable),
    combineWidgets(
      ncol = 1,
      myHist(year, "V1"),
      myHist(year, "V2"),
      myHist(year, "V3"),
    )
  )
}

manipulateWidget(
  myPlotFun(year, variable),
  year = mwSlider(2000, 2016, value = 2000),
  variable = mwSelect(c("V1", "V2", "V3"))
)
</pre>
<p>Of course, <code>combineWidgets</code> can be used outside of
<code>manipulateWidget</code>. For instance, it can be used in an
Rmarkdown document to easily put together interactive charts.
</p>
<p>For more concrete examples of usage, you should look at the documentation and
especially the examples of <code>manipulateWidget</code> and
<code>combineWidgets</code>.
