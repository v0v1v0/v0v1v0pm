<h2>Enumerate All Indirect Effects in a Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check all indirect paths in a model and
return them as a list of arguments of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>,
and <code>m</code>, to be used by <code>indirect_effect()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">all_indirect_paths(
  fit = NULL,
  exclude = NULL,
  x = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  group = NULL
)

all_paths_to_df(all_paths)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fit</code></td>
<td>
<p>A fit object. It can be the output of
<code>lavaan::lavaan()</code> or its wrapper such as <code>lavaan::sem()</code>,
or a list of the output of <code>lm()</code> or the output of
<code>lm2list()</code>.
If it is a single model fitted by
<code>lm()</code>, it will be automatically converted
to a list by <code>lm2list()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exclude</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of variables to be excluded
in the search, such as control variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of variables that will be
included as the <code>x</code> variables. If supplied, only
paths that start from these variables will be included
in the search.
If <code>NULL</code>, the default, then all variables that are
one of the predictors in at least one regression
equation will be
included in the search.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of variables that will be
included as the <code>y</code> variables. If supplied, only
paths that start from these variables will be included
in the search.
If <code>NULL</code>, the default, then all variables that are
the outcome variables in at least one regression
equation will be
included in the search.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either the group number
as appeared in the <code>summary()</code>
or <code>lavaan::parameterEstimates()</code>
output of a lavaan::lavaan object,
or the group label as used in
the lavaan::lavaan object.
Used only when the number of
groups is greater than one. Default
is <code>NULL</code>. If not specified by the model
has more than one group, than paths
that appears in at least one group
will be included in the output.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>all_paths</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>all_paths</code>-class object. For example,
the output of <code>all_indirect_paths()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It makes use of <code>igraph::all_simple_paths()</code>
to identify paths in a model.
</p>


<h4>Multigroup Models</h4>

<p>Since Version 0.1.14.2, support for
multigroup models has been added for models
fitted by <code>lavaan</code>. If a model has more
than one group and <code>group</code> is not
specified, than paths in all groups
will be returned. If <code>group</code> is
specified, than only paths in the
selected group will be returned.
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>all_indirect_paths()</code> returns
a list of the class <code>all_paths</code>. Each argument is a
list of three character vectors,
<code>x</code>, the name of the predictor that starts a path, <code>y</code>,
the name of the outcome that ends a path, and <code>m</code>, a
character vector of one or more names of the mediators,
from <code>x</code> to <code>y</code>. This class has a print method.
</p>
<p><code>all_paths_to_df()</code> returns a data frame with three
columns, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>m</code>, which can be used by
functions such as <code>indirect_effect()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Functions</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>all_indirect_paths()</code>: Enumerate all indirect paths.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>all_paths_to_df()</code>: Convert the output of
<code>all_indirect_paths()</code> to a data frame with
three columns: <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>m</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
