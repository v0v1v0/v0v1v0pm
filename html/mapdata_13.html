World Map

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This (legacy) world database comes from a cleaned-up version of the CIA
World Data Bank II data and contains approximately 2 million points
representing the world coastlines and national boundaries.  This
makes it suitable for extracting countries, continents, etc. while
still retaining lots of detail.
</p>
<p>The ‘world2’ database is a modified version of the ‘world’ database
in which the longitude ranges from 0 through 360 degrees, instead of
-180 through 180.  This then allows maps of the whole Pacific Ocean for
example.
</p>
<p><code>worldLores</code> contains exactly the same polygon information, but the boundaries have been reduced to a very low resolution.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data file is merely an assignment to a character string which
specifies the name of an environment variable which contains the
base location of the binary files used by the map drawing functions.
This environment variable (<code>R_MAPDATA_DATA_DIR</code> for the datasets in the
mapdata package) is set at package load time.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This database was compiled in the 1990's and does not reflect more recent political changes. It is maintained mainly for historical purposes and legacy code. The data in <code>maps::world</code> on in packages like <code>rnaturalearth</code> is much more up to date.</p>
