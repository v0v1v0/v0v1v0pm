<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data contains packet arrivals seen on an Ethernet at the Bellcore
Morristown Research and Engineering facility. Two of the traces are LAN
traffic (with a small portion of transit WAN traffic), and two are WAN
traffic. The original trace BC-pAug89 began at 11:25 on August 29, 1989,
and ran for about 3142.82 seconds (until 1,000,000 packets had been captured).
The trace BC-pOct89 began at 11:00 on October 5, 1989, and ran for about
1759.62 seconds. These two traces captured all Ethernet packets.
The number of arrivals in the original trace is one million.
