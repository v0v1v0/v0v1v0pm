<h2>Calculate number of fatalities of conflict events from ACLED</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The indicator aggregated the number of fatalities within a given asset
on a monthly cadence stratified either by event type, sub-event type or disorder
type. To learn about the different categorisation ACLED uses to encode events
please consult ACLED's codebook.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calc_fatalities_acled(
  years = 2000,
  stratum = c("event_type", "sub_event_type", "disorder_type"),
  precision_location = 1,
  precision_time = 1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>years</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector indicating the years for which to summarize
fatalities.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stratum</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector indicating the stratification to be applied.
Should be one of "event_type", "sub_event_type", or "disorder_type".
Defaults to "event_type".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>precision_location</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric indicating precision value for the
geolocation up to which events are included. Defaults to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>precision_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric indicating the precision value of the
temporal coding up to which events are included. Defaults to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The required resources for this indicator are:
</p>

<ul><li> <p>acled
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>You may apply quality filters based on the precision of the geolocation
of events and the temporal precision. By default, these are set to only
include events with the highest precision scores.
</p>
<p>For geo-precision there are levels 1 to 3 with decreasing accuracy:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> value 1: the source reporting indicates a particular town, and coordinates
are available for that town
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> value 2: the source material indicates that activity took place in a
small part of a region, and mentions a general area or if an activity
occurs near a town or a city, the event is coded to a town with
geo-referenced coordinates to represent that area
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> value 3: a larger region is mentioned, the closest natural location noted
in reporting (like “border area,” “forest,” or “sea,” among others) – or a
provincial capital is used if no other information at all is available
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For temporal precision there are levels 1 to 3 with decreasing precision:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> value 1: the source material includes an actual date of an event
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> value 2: the source material indicates that an event happened sometime
during the week or within a similar period of time
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> value 3: the source material only indicates that an event took place
sometime during a month (i.e. in the past two or three weeks, or in
January), without reference to the particular date, the month mid-point
is chosen
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A function that returns an indicator tibble with the type of
violence as variable and counts of civilian fatalities as value.
