<h2>Calculate carbon statistics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions allow to calculated statistics based on the harmonized
carbon layers for 2010 and 2018 by Noon et al. (2022).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calc_irr_carbon(
  type = c("total", "soil", "biomass", "all"),
  engine = "extract",
  stats = "mean"
)

calc_man_carbon(
  type = c("total", "soil", "biomass", "all"),
  engine = "extract",
  stats = "mean"
)

calc_vul_carbon(
  type = c("total", "soil", "biomass", "all"),
  engine = "extract",
  stats = "mean"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>One of "total", "soil", "biomass", "all". Determines
for which data layer the statistics are calculated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>engine</code></td>
<td>
<p>The preferred processing functions from either one of "zonal",
"extract" or "exactextract" as character.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stats</code></td>
<td>
<p>Function to be applied to compute statistics for polygons either
one or multiple inputs as character. Supported statistics are: "mean",
"median", "sd", "min", "max", "sum", and "var".</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The required resources for these indicators are:
</p>

<ul><li> <p>carbon_resources
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Irrecoverable carbon is the amount of carbon that, if lost today, could not
be recovered until 2050. It can be calculated for above- and below-ground
carbon, the total amount of carbon, or for all layers.
</p>
<p>Manageable carbon is the amount of carbon that, in principle, is manageable
by human activities, e.g. its release to the atmosphere can be prevented.
It can be calculated for above- and below-ground carbon, the total amount
of carbon, or for all layers.
</p>
<p>Vulnerable carbon is the amount of carbon that would be released in a typical
land conversion activity.
It can be calculated for above- and below-ground carbon, the total amount
of carbon, or for all layers.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A function that returns an indicator tibble with <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠(type)_carbon_(stat)⁠</code>
as variable and the respective statistic (in Mg) as value.
</p>
