<h2>Global Surface Water Seasonality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Global Surface Water dataset was developed by the European Commission's
Joint Research Centre in the framework of the Copernicus Programme. It maps
the location and temporal distribution of water surfaces at the global scale
over the past 3.8 decades and provides statistics on their extent and change.
It is provisioned as a global tiled raster resource available for all land
areas. The reported data represent aggregated observations between 1984 - 2021.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_global_surface_water_seasonality(version = "v1_4_2021")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>version</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector indicating the version of the GSW data set
to make available.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>GSW seasonality describes the intra-annual distribution of surface water for
each pixel. The raster files have integer cell values between <code>[0, 12]</code>,
indicating how many months per year the pixel was classified as water.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character of file paths.
