<h2>Carbon Layers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These resources are from the publication by Noon et al. (2022) "Mapping the
irrecoverable carbon in Earth’s ecosystems". This publication differentiates
between 3 different kinds of carbon with varying degrees of manageability
by humans. All three layers are available for above and below ground
carbon, as well as a layer combining the two.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_irr_carbon()

get_vul_carbon()

get_man_carbon()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It may be required to increase the timeout option to successfully download
theses layers from their source location via e.g. <code>options(timeout = 600)</code>.
</p>
<p>Irrecoverable carbon is defined as the amount of carbon, that, if lost today,
cannot be recovered until mid 21st century (so within 30 years, considering
the publication date).
</p>
<p>Vulnerable carbon is defined as the amount of carbon that would be lost in a
hypothetical but typical conversion event (without including information
of the probability of such an event to be actually occurring).
</p>
<p>Manageable carbon is defined as all land areas, expect cyrosols, because
carbon loss is driven by direct land-use conversion which could be halted or
because climate change impacts affecting the area can potentially be directly
mitigated through adaptive management.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A function that returns an <code>sf</code> footprint object.
