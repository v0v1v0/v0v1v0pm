<h2>
Data visualisation on maps
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create simple maps; add sub-plots like pie plots to a map or any other plot; format, plot and export gridded data. The package was developed for displaying fisheries data but most functions can be used for more generic data visualisation.
For a complete list of functions with individual help pages, use <code>library(help="mapplots")</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The starting point is generally the function <code>basemap</code> which creates a blank map (although most mapplots functions could be applied to any plot, not just maps). Coastlines or other features can be added to the map with the function <code>draw.shape</code>. ICES rectangles can also be displayed on the map and axes by <code>draw.rect</code>. The main purpose of this package is to visualise data on maps. For univariate data, the main functions are <code>draw.bubble</code> (bubble plots) and <code>draw.grid</code> (heat maps). Multivariate data can be displayed with <code>draw.barplot2D</code> ('square pie plots'), <code>draw.pie</code> (pie plots) and <code>draw.xy</code> (xy or barplots). Some of these have a specific function for displaying a legend: <code>legend.bubble</code>, <code>legend.grid</code> and <code>legend.pie</code>. The following functions can help to get data in the right format for plotting: <code>make.grid</code> and <code>make.multigrid</code> (to create grd objects for <code>draw.grid</code>) and <code>make.xyz</code> (to create xyz objects for <code>draw.barplot2D</code> and <code>draw.pie</code>). Finally, there is a functions to export grd objects as csv or shapefiles: <code>write.grid</code>. The remaining functions are called by the main funcions listed above and were never intended to be used directly. However, they are documented and can be called directly.
