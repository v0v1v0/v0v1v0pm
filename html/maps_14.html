<h2>
France Map
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This france database comes from the NUTS III (Tertiary Administrative
Units of the European Community) database of the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) GRID-Geneva data sets. These were prepared
around 1989, and so may be somewhat out of date.
</p>
<p>Users of data sets supplied through UNEP/GRID are requested to
incorporate in output products and reports acknowledgements to the
originator of the data and to the fact that they were acquired through
UNEP/GRID. Appropriate wording may be "UNESCO (1987) through
UNEP/GRID-Geneva".
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(franceMapEnv)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data file is merely a character string which
specifies the name of an environment variable which contains the
base location of the binary files used by the map drawing functions.
This environment variable (<code>R_MAP_DATA_DIR</code> for the datasets in the
maps package) is set at package load time <em>if it does not
already exist</em>. Hence setting the environment variable before loading
the package can override the default location of the binary datasets.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This map database can now easily be replaced by data taken directly from free sources, e.g. Natural Earth (see example).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">map('france', fill = TRUE, col = 1:10)
# replace by a public domain map at higher resolution:
# fr1 &lt;- rnaturalearth::ne_states("france")
# this still includes overseas domains, so we remove those:
# france2 &lt;- map(fr1, xlim=c(-20, 20), ylim=c(30, 60), lforce="e",
#                fill=TRUE, plot=FALSE)
