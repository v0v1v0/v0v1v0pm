<h2>
Italy Map
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This italy database comes from the NUTS III (Tertiary Administrative
Units of the European Community) database of the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) GRID-Geneva data sets. These were prepared
around 1989, and so may be somewhat out of date.
</p>
<p>Users of data sets supplied through UNEP/GRID are requested to
incorporate in output products and reports acknowledgements to the
originator of the data and to the fact that they were acquired through
UNEP/GRID. Appropriate wording may be "UNESCO (1987) through
UNEP/GRID-Geneva". 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(italyMapEnv)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data file is merely a character string which
specifies the name of an environment variable which contains the
base location of the binary files used by the map drawing functions.
This environment variable (<code>R_MAP_DATA_DIR</code> for the datasets in the
maps package) is set at package load time <em>if it does not
already exist</em>. Hence setting the environment variable before loading
the package can override the default location of the binary datasets.
