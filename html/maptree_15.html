<h2>Hexagonal Grid Cell Polygons covering Oregon, USA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Polygon borders for 389 hexagonal grid cells covering Oregon, USA,
in <code>polygon</code> format.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data (oregon.grid)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 3112 rows and 2 columns (the components
<code>"x"</code> and <code>"y"</code>).</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The polygon format used for these grid cell boundaries is a slight
variation from the standard R/S format.  Each cell polygon is
described by seven coordinate pairs, the last repeating the first.
Prior to the first coordinate pair of each cell is a row containing
NA in the <code>"y"</code> column and, in the <code>"x"</code> column, an
identifier for the cell.  The identifiers are the same as the
row names in <code>oregon.bird.dist</code> and
<code>oregon.env.vars</code>.  See <code>map.groups</code> for
how the linkage is made in mapping.
</p>
<p>These grid cells are extracted from a larger set covering the
conterminous United States and adjacent parts of Canada and
Mexico, as described in White et al. (1992).  Only cells with
at least 50 percent of their area contained within the state of
Oregon are included.
</p>
<p>The map projection for the coordinates, as well as the point
coordinates in <code>oregon.env.vars</code>, is the Lambert
Conformal Conic with standard parallels at 33 and 45
degrees North latitude, with the longitude of the central
meridian at 120 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude,
and with the projection origin latitude at 41 degrees,
45 minutes North latitude.
