<h2>The Atomic Weights of Chemical Elements</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Atomic weights of chemical elements according to the IUPAC table.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">AtomicWeight
atomicweight
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The capitalized version <code>AtomicWeight</code> is a data frame containing
the IUPAC table of atomic weights.
This data frame has following colums: Number, Name,
Symbol, Weight, Footnotes.
</p>
<p>Note that as in the IUPAC table, the Weight is
given as a text rather than as numeric objects. It comprises the standard
values and the uncertainties (in parentheses, following the last significant
figure to which they are attributed).
See IUPAC report for explanation of the Footnotes.
</p>
<p>The lower case version <code>atomicweight</code> is a simplified list that only
contains the weights (as numeric values) and allows symbolic
computations with elements to arrive at molecular weights.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Molecular weights of chemical elements may vary due to different isotope
compositions, depending on geology, industrial processes or biological activity.
Please consult the IUPAC Technical report about the details.
The data set contains <code>NA</code> for elements that have no stable isotopes
(except U, Th, Pa).
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## assess the data in the IUPAC table (with all footnotes)
AtomicWeight[1:20,]
AtomicWeight[AtomicWeight$Symbol == "C",]

## use the lower case version for simple calculations:
atomicweight$C
with(atomicweight, C)

## it can also be used to calculate molecular weights
## via symbolic computation
with(atomicweight, H * 2 + O)
