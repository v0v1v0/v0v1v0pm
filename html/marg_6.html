<h2>Darwin's Data on Growth Rates of Plants</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>darwin</code> data frame has 15 rows and 3 columns.
</p>
<p>Charles Darwin conducted an experiment to examine the superiority of
cross-fertilized plants over self-fertilized plants.  15 pairs of
plants were used. Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized plant
and one self-fertilized plant which germinated at the same time and
grew in the same pot. The heights of the plants were measured at a
fixed time after planting.  Four different pots were used.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>cross</code></dt>
<dd> 
<p>the heights of the cross-fertilized plants (in inches);
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>self</code></dt>
<dd>  
<p>the heights of the self-fertilized plants (in inches);
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pot</code></dt>
<dd>   
<p>a factor variable for the pot number.
