<h2>Various utility functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Several functions have been added to help visualize data including resight.matrix
which provides for each cohort the number of releases on the diagonal and the number 
resighted on each occasion in the upper-triangular matrix. naive.survival
provides a naive survival estimate at each time for each cohort.  The estimate for
time i is the number resighted at time i+1 or later divided by the number seen at time i or later.
These values should be interpreted cautiously because they are influenced by capture probability in
year i but it is useful to identify particularly high or low survival values. Functions Phi.mean
and p.mean compute average real parameter values Phi or p across time for a single age or across ages for a
single time.
