<h2>Process encounter history dataframe for MARK analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Prior to analyzing the data, this function initializes several variables
(e.g., number of capture occasions, time intervals) that are often specific
to the capture-recapture model being fitted to the data.  It also is used to
1) define groups in the data that represent different levels of one or morestrata.labels
factor covariates (e.g., sex), 2) define time intervals between capture
occasions (if not 1), and 3) create an age structure for the data, if any.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">process.data(data,begin.time=1,model="CJS",mixtures=1,groups=NULL,
                       allgroups=FALSE,age.var=NULL,initial.ages=c(0), 
                       time.intervals=NULL,nocc=NULL,accumulate=TRUE,
                       strata.labels=NULL)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For examples of <code>data</code>, see <code>dipper</code>. The structure of the
encounter history and the analysis depends on the analysis model to some
extent. Thus, it is necessary to process a dataframe with the encounter
history (<code>ch</code>) and a chosen <code>model</code> to define the relevant values.
For example, number of capture occasions (<code>nocc</code>) is automatically
computed based on the length of the encounter history (<code>ch</code>) in
<code>data</code>. 
The default time interval is unit time (1) and if this is
adequate, the function will assign the appropriate length.  A processed data
frame can only be analyzed using the model that was specified.  The
<code>model</code> value is used by the functions <code>make.design.data</code>
and <code>crm</code> to define the model structure as it relates to the
data. Thus, if the data are going to be analysed with different underlying
models, create different processed data sets with the model name as an
extension.  For example, <code>dipper.cjs=process.data(dipper)</code>.
</p>
<p>This function will report inconsistencies in the lengths of the capture
history values and when invalid entries are given in the capture history.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>begin.time</code> specifies the time for the first capture
occasion and not the first time the particular animal was caught or releaed.  This is used in creating the levels of the time factor variable
in the design data and for labelling parameters. If the <code>begin.time</code>
varies by group, enter a vector of times with one for each group. It will add a field
begin.time to the data with the value for each individual.  You can also specify a
begin.time field in the data allowing each animal to have a unique begin.time. Note that
the time values for survivals are based on the beginning of the survival
interval and capture probabilities are labeled based on the time of the
capture occasion.  Likewise, age labels for survival are the ages at the
beginning times of the intervals and for capture probabilities it is the age
at the time of capture/recapture. 
</p>
<p>The time.intervals argument can either be a vector of lengths of times for each interval between occasions
that is constant for all animals or a matrix which has a row for each animal and a column for each
interval which lets the intervals vary by animals. These intervals are used to construct the design data
and are used for the field time.interval which is used to adjust parameters like Phi and S to a constant per
unit time interval (eg annual survival rates). On occasion it can be useful to leave the time.interval to 
remain at default of 1 or some other vector of time.intervals to construct the design data and then modify the 
time.interval value in the design data.  For example, assume that cohort marking and release is done between
sampling occasions.  The initial survival from release to the next sampling occasion may vary by release
cohort, but the remainder of the surivivals are between sampling occasions.  In that case it is easier to 
let time.interval=1 (assuming unit interval (eg year) between sampling occasions but then modifying ddl$Phi$time.interval
to the value for the first interval after each release to be the partial year from release to next sampling occasion. In
this way everything is labelled with annual quantities but the first partial year survival is adjusted to an annual rate.
</p>
<p>Note that if you specify time.intervals as a matrix, then accumulate is set to FALSE so that the number of 
rows in the data can be checked against the number of rows in the time.intervals matrix and thus data cannot be
accumulated because at present it doesn't use values of time.intervals to determine which records can be accumulated.
</p>
<p><code>groups</code> is a vector of variable names that are contained in
<code>data</code>.  Each must be a factor variable. A group is created for each
unique combination of the levels of the factor variables.  For
example <code>groups=c("sex","ageclass","region")</code> creates
groups defined by the levels of <code>sex</code>, <code>ageclass</code> and <code>region</code>.
the code will only use groups that have 1 or more capture histories unless <code>allgroups=TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>age.var=2</code> specifies that the second grouping variable in
<code>groups</code> represents an age variable.  It could have been named
something different than ageclass but it should not be named age as that is reserved in marked. 
<code>initial.age</code> specifies that the age at first capture of the age levels. For example
initial.age=0:2 specifies that the initial.ages are 0,1 and 2 for the age class levels 
designated as 1,2,3. The actual ages
for the age classes do not have to be sequential or ordered, but ordering
will cause less confusion.  Thus levels 1,2,3 could represent initial ages
of 0,4,6 or 6,0,4. The default for <code>initial.age</code>
is 0 for each group, in which case, <code>age</code> represents time since marking
(first capture) rather than the actual age of the animal. If the data contains an initial.age field
then it overrides any other values and lets each animal have a unique initial.age at first capture/release.
</p>
<p>The following variable names are reserved and should not be used in the data:
id (animal id)
ch(capture history)
freq (number of animals with that ch/data)
occ,age,time,cohort,Age,Time,Cohort,time.interval,fix
