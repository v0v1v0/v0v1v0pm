<h2>Tidy Calculation of Net Promoter Score</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simplifies the calculation of Net Promoter Score (NPS) from raw survey data within
the tidyverse framework.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nps_calc(survey_data, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>survey_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Raw survey data. Needs to be one row per survey with the nps question
in a numeric column called nps_question</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional columns by which to group the nps calculation. There is no limit to
the number of grouping variables chosen. Too many will likely result in nps calculations
that are too fragmented / based on very small survey counts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Net Promoter Score was originally developed by Fred Reichheld and now is owned by

</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data frame with nps and survey count for each combination of the grouping variables
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nps_question &lt;- sample(10, 100, replace = TRUE)
nps_date &lt;- rep(seq.Date(from = as.Date("2019-01-01"), to = as.Date("2019-01-10"), by = "day"), 10)
nps_group &lt;- rep(c("a", "b", "c", "d"), 25)
df &lt;- data.frame(nps_question, nps_date, nps_group)
nps_calc(df, nps_group)
</code></pre>
