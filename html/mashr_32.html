<h2>Compute the proportion of (significant) signals shared by
magnitude in each pair of conditions, based on the poterior mean</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute the proportion of (significant) signals shared by
magnitude in each pair of conditions, based on the poterior mean
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_pairwise_sharing(m, factor = 0.5, lfsr_thresh = 0.05, FUN = identity)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>the mash fit</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>factor</code></td>
<td>
<p>a number in [0,1] the factor within which effects are
considered to be shared</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lfsr_thresh</code></td>
<td>
<p>the lfsr threshold for including an effect in
the assessment</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FUN</code></td>
<td>
<p>a function to be applied to the estimated effect sizes
before assessing sharing. The most obvious choice beside the
default 'FUN=identity' would be 'FUN=abs' if you want to ignore the
sign of the effects when assesing sharing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For each pair of tissues, first identify the effects that
are significant (by lfsr&lt;lfsr_thresh) in at least one of the two
tissues. Then compute what fraction of these have an estimated
(posterior mean) effect size within a factor 'factor' of one
another. The results are returned as an R by R matrix.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simdata = simple_sims(50,5,1)
data = mash_set_data(simdata$Bhat, simdata$Shat)
m = mash(data, cov_canonical(data))
get_pairwise_sharing(m) # sharing by magnitude (same sign)
get_pairwise_sharing(m, factor=0) # sharing by sign
get_pairwise_sharing(m, FUN=abs) # sharing by magnitude when sign is ignored
</code></pre>
