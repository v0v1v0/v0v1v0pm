<h2>
<code>masscor</code>: Mass Measurement Corrections and Uncertainties.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>R</code> package <code>masscor</code> provides functions, classes and methods
to support mass measurements using non automatic balances as described in
EURAMET's Calibration Guide No. 18 (2015).
The new classes are objects that can store the calibration information for
balances and mass standards. Those objects can be used to convert balance readings to
both conventional mass and mass, and to perform routine balance verification
(by using the normalized error function).
Air buoyancy correction factors are calculated using local air density that
can be calculated using environmental conditions and applying one
of several models available in the package. The uncertainty of (corrected)
mass measurements can also be evaluated allowing us to further assess the suitability
of given mass measurement.
</p>


<h3>
<code>masscor</code> functions</h3>

<p>This package uses list objects of class <code>'calibCert'</code> to store information
of balance calibration certificates.
The functions use the information of this object to convert balance reading
indications to conventional mass and calculate mass
uncertainties.
</p>
<p>Several models for calculating air density are included and this
information can be used to calculate the
Magnitude of the Air Buoyancy Correction factor (MABC).
Uncertainties calculations are made using Gauss Approximation according to the
Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) implemented in
<code>R</code> by the package
metRology (Ellison, 2018).
