<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class responses of length 4, which contains the incomplete correlate distractors of a matriks (IC-Inc, IC-Flip, IC-Neg, IC-Size). If the distractor could not be generated because of the constraints imposed by the matrix, it will be covered by a thick, black X and a warning is given.
