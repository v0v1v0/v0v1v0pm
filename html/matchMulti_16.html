<h2>A function that performs multilevel matching.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the workhorse function in the package which matches groups and units
within groups. For example, it will match both schools and students in
schools, where the goal is to make units more comparable to estimate
treatment effects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">matchMulti(
  data,
  treatment,
  school.id,
  match.students = TRUE,
  student.vars = NULL,
  school.caliper = NULL,
  school.fb = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  keep.target = NULL,
  student.penalty.qtile = 0.05,
  min.keep.pctg = 0.8,
  school.penalty = NULL,
  save.first.stage = TRUE,
  tol = 10,
  solver = "rlemon"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame for use in matching.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatment</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of covariate that defines treated and control groups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>school.id</code></td>
<td>
<p>Identifier for groups (for example schools)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>match.students</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical flag for whether units within groups should
also be matched.  If set to <code>FALSE</code>, all units will be retained in
both groups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>student.vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>Names of student level covariates on which to measure
balance.  School-level distances will be penalized when student mathces are
imbalanced on these variables. In addition, when <code>match.students</code> is
<code>TRUE</code>, students are matched on a distance computed from these
covariates.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>school.caliper</code></td>
<td>
<p>matrix with one row for each treated school and one
column for each control school, containing zeroes for pairings allowed by
the caliper and <code>Inf</code> values for forbidden pairings.  When <code>NULL</code>
no caliper is imposed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>school.fb</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of discrete group-level covariates on which to
enforce fine balance, i.e., ensure marginal distributions are balanced.
First group is most important, second is second most, etc.  If a simple
list of variable names, one group is assumed.  A list of list will give
this hierarchy.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical flag for whether to give detailed output.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep.target</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional numeric value specifying the number of treated
schools desired in the final match.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>student.penalty.qtile</code></td>
<td>
<p>This helps exclude students if they are
difficult to match. Default is 0.05, which implies that in the match we
would prefer to exclude students rather than match them at distances larger
than this quantile of the overall student-student robust Mahalanobis
distance distribution</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min.keep.pctg</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum percentage of students (from smaller school) to
keep when matching students in each school pair.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>school.penalty</code></td>
<td>
<p>A penalty to remove groups (schools) in the group
(school) match</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>save.first.stage</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should first stage matches be saved.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tol</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric tolerance value for comparing distances, used in the
school match.  It may need to be raised above the default when matching 
with many levels of refined balance or in very large problems (when these
distances will often be  at least on the order of the tens of 
thousands).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>solver</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of package used to solve underlying network flow problem
for the school match, one of 'rlemon' and 'rrelaxiv'.  rrelaxiv carries an 
academic license and is not hosted on CRAN so it must be installed 
separately.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>matchMulti</code> first matches students (or other individual units) within
each pairwise combination of schools (or other groups); based on these
matches a distance matrix is generated for the schools.  Then schools are
matched on this distance matrix and the student matches for the selected
school pairs are combined into a single matched sample.
</p>
<p>School covariates are not used to compute the distance matrix for schools
(since it is generated from the student match).  Instead imbalances in school
covariates should be addressed through the<code>school.fb</code> argument, which
encodes a refined covariate balance constraint. School covariates in
<code>school.fb</code> should be given in order of priority for balance, since the
matching algorithm optimally balances the variables in the first list
element, then attempts to further balance the those in the second element,
and so on.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>raw</code></td>
<td>
<p>The unmatched data before matching.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>matched</code></td>
<td>
<p>The
matched dataset of both units and groups. Outcome analysis and balance
checks are peformed on this item.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>school.match</code></td>
<td>
<p>Object with two
parts. The first lists which treated groups (schools) are matched to which
control groups. The second lists the population of groups used in the
match.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>school.id</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of school identifier</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatment</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name
of treatment variable</p>
</td>
