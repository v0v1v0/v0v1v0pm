<h2>matchingR: Matching Algorithms in R and C++</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>matchingR is an R package which quickly computes a variety of
matching algorithms for one-sided and two-sided markets. This package
implements
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the Gale-Shapley Algorithm to compute the stable matching for
two-sided markets, such as the stable marriage problem and the
college-admissions problem
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irving's Algorithm to compute the stable matching for one-sided
markets such as the stable roommates problem
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the top trading cycle algorithm for the indivisible goods trading
problem.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All matching algorithms are implemented in <code>C++</code> and can therefore be
computed quickly. The package may be useful when the number of market
participants is large or when many matchings need to be computed (e.g. for
extensive simulations or for estimation purposes). The Gale-Shapley
function of this package has successfully been used to simulate preferences
and compute the matching with 30,000 participants on each side of the
market.
</p>
<p>Matching markets are common in practice and widely studied by
economists. Popular examples include
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>the National Resident Matching Program that matches graduates from
medical school to residency programs at teaching hospitals throughout the
United States
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the matching of students to schools including the New York City High
School Match or the the Boston Public School Match (and many more)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the matching of kidney donors to recipients in kidney exchanges.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
