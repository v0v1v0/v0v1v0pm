<h2>Gale-Shapley Algorithm: College Admissions Problem</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes the Gale-Shapley algorithm and finds a solution to the
college admissions problem. In the student-optimal college admissions
problem, <code>n</code> students apply to <code>m</code> colleges, where each college has
<code>s</code> slots.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">galeShapley.collegeAdmissions(
  studentUtils = NULL,
  collegeUtils = NULL,
  studentPref = NULL,
  collegePref = NULL,
  slots = 1,
  studentOptimal = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>studentUtils</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix with cardinal utilities of the students. If
there are <code>n</code> students and <code>m</code> colleges, then this matrix will be
of dimension <code>m</code> by <code>n</code>. The <code>i,j</code>th element refers to the
payoff that student <code>j</code> receives from being matched to college
<code>i</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>collegeUtils</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix with cardinal utilities of colleges. If there
are <code>n</code> students and <code>m</code> colleges, then this matrix will be of
dimension <code>n</code> by <code>m</code>. The <code>i,j</code>th element refers to the
payoff that college <code>j</code> receives from being matched to student
<code>i</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>studentPref</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix with the preference order of the proposing
side of the market (only required when <code>studentUtils</code> is not
provided). If there are <code>n</code> students and <code>m</code> colleges in the
market, then this matrix will be of dimension <code>m</code> by <code>n</code>. The
<code>i,j</code>th element refers to student <code>j</code>'s <code>i</code>th most favorite
college. Preference orders can either be specified using R-indexing
(starting at 1) or C++ indexing (starting at 0).</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>collegePref</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a matrix with the preference order of the courted side
of the market (only required when <code>collegeUtils</code> is not provided). If
there are <code>n</code> students and <code>m</code> colleges in the market, then this
matrix will be of dimension <code>n</code> by <code>m</code>. The <code>i,j</code>th element
refers to individual <code>j</code>'s <code>i</code>th most favorite partner.
Preference orders can either be specified using R-indexing (starting at 1)
or C++ indexing (starting at 0).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>slots</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the number of slots that each college has available. If this
is 1, then the algorithm is identical to
<code>galeShapley.marriageMarket</code>. <code>slots</code> can either be a
integer or a vector. If it is an integer, then all colleges have the
same number of slots. If it is a vector, it must have as many elements
as there are colleges where each element refers to the number of slots
at a particular college.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>studentOptimal</code></td>
<td>
<p>is <code>TRUE</code> if students apply to colleges. The
resulting match is student-optimal. <code>studentOptimal</code> is <code>FALSE</code>
if colleges apply to students. The resulting match is college-optimal.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The algorithm works analogously to galeShapley.marriageMarket. The
Gale-Shapley algorithm works as follows: Students ("the proposers")
sequentially make proposals to each of their most preferred available
colleges ("the reviewers"). A college can hold on to at most <code>s</code>
proposals at a time. A college with an open slot will accept any application
that it receives. A college that already holds on to <code>s</code> applications
will reject any application by a student that it values less than her current
set of applicants. If a college receives an application from a student that
it values more than its current set of applicants, then it will accept the
application and drop its least preferred current applicant. This process
continues until all students are matched to colleges.
</p>
<p>The Gale-Shapley Algorithm requires a complete specification of students' and
colleges' preferences over each other. Preferences can be passed on to the
algorithm in ordinal form (e.g. student 3 prefers college 1 over college 3
over college 2) or in cardinal form (e.g. student 3 receives payoff 3.14 from
being matched to college 1, payoff 2.51 from being matched to college 3 and
payoff 2.13 from being matched to college 2). Preferences must be complete,
i.e. all students must have fully specified preferences over all colleges and
vice versa.
</p>
<p>In the version of the algorithm that is implemented here, all individuals –
colleges and students – prefer being matched to anyone to not being matched
at all.
</p>
<p>The algorithm still works with an unequal number of students and slots. In
that case some students will remain unmatched or some slots will remain open.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with elements that specify which student is matched to which
college and who remains unmatched. Suppose there are <code>n</code> students and
<code>m</code> colleges with <code>s</code> slots. The list contains the following
items:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>matched.students</code> is a vector of length <code>n</code> whose <code>i</code>th
element contains college that student <code>i</code> is
matched to. Students that remain unmatched will be listed as being
matched to college <code>NA</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>matched.colleges</code> is a matrix of dimension <code>m</code> by
<code>s</code> whose <code>j</code>th row contains the students that were admitted to
college <code>j</code>. Slots that remain open show up as being matched to
student to <code>NA</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>unmatched.students</code> is a vector that lists the remaining unmatched
students This vector will be empty when all students get matched.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>unmatched.colleges</code> is a vector that lists colleges with open
slots. If a college has multiple open slots, it will show up multiple
times. This vector will be empty whenever all college slots get filled.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
