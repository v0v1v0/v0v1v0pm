<h2>Apply functions to each matrix of a matrixset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>apply_matrix</code> function applies functions to each matrix of a <code>matrixset</code>.
The <code>apply_row</code>/<code>apply_column</code> functions do the same but separately for each
row/column. The functions can be applied to all matrices or only a subset.
</p>
<p>The <code>dfl</code>/<code>dfw</code> versions differ in their output format and when possible,
always return a <code>tibble()</code>.
</p>
<p>Empty matrices are simply left unevaluated. How that impacts the returned
result depends on which flavor of apply_* has been used. See ‘Value’
for more details.
</p>
<p>If <code>.matrix_wise</code> is <code>FALSE</code>, the function (or expression) is multivariate in
the sense that all matrices are accessible at once, as opposed to each of them
in turn.
</p>
<p>See section "Multivariate".
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">apply_row(.ms, ..., .matrix = NULL, .matrix_wise = TRUE, .input_list = FALSE)

apply_row_dfl(
  .ms,
  ...,
  .matrix = NULL,
  .matrix_wise = TRUE,
  .input_list = FALSE,
  .force_name = FALSE
)

apply_row_dfw(
  .ms,
  ...,
  .matrix = NULL,
  .matrix_wise = TRUE,
  .input_list = FALSE,
  .force_name = FALSE
)

apply_column(
  .ms,
  ...,
  .matrix = NULL,
  .matrix_wise = TRUE,
  .input_list = FALSE
)

apply_column_dfl(
  .ms,
  ...,
  .matrix = NULL,
  .matrix_wise = TRUE,
  .input_list = FALSE,
  .force_name = FALSE
)

apply_column_dfw(
  .ms,
  ...,
  .matrix = NULL,
  .matrix_wise = TRUE,
  .input_list = FALSE,
  .force_name = FALSE
)

apply_matrix(
  .ms,

<p>expressions, separated by commas. They can be specified in one of
the following way:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> a function name, e.g., <code>mean</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> a function call, where you can use .m to represent the current matrix
(for <code>apply_matrix</code>),.i<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠to represent the current row (for⁠</code>apply_row<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠) and.j⁠</code> for the current column (<code>apply_column</code>). Bare names of object
traits can be used as well. For instance, <code>lm(.i ~ program)</code>.
</p>
<p>The pronouns are also available for the multivariate version, under
certain circumstances, but they have a different meaning. See the
"Multivariate" section for more details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> a formula expression. The pronouns .m, .i and
.j' can be used as well. See examples to see the usefulness
of this.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The expressions can be named; these names will be used to provide names to
the results.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>matrix indices of which matrix to apply functions to. The
default, <code>NULL</code>, means all the matrices are used.
</p>
<p>If not <code>NULL</code>, index is numeric or character vectors.
</p>
<p>Numeric values are coerced to integer as by <code>as.integer()</code> (and hence
truncated towards zero).
</p>
<p>Character vectors will be matched to the matrix names of the object.
</p>
<p>Can also be logical vectors, indicating elements/slices to replace. Such
vectors are <em>NOT</em> recycled, which is an important difference with usual
matrix replacement. It means that the <code>logical</code> vector must match the
number of matrices in length.
</p>
<p>Can also be negative integers, indicating elements/slices to leave out of
the replacement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.matrix_wise</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code>. By default (<code>TRUE</code>), matrices are provided
one by one, in turn, to the functions/expressions. But if <code>.matrix_wise</code> is
<code>FALSE</code>, the functions/expressions have access to all matrices. See
"Multivariate" for details, including how to reference the matrices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.input_list</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code>. If multivariate (<code>.matrix_wise ==  FALSE</code>),
the matrices are provided as a single list, where each element is a matrix
(or matrix row or column). The list elements are the matrix names.</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.force_name</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code>. Used only for the simplified output versions
(dfl/dfw). By default (<code>FALSE</code>), function IDs will be provided only if the
function outcome is a vector of length 2 or more. If <code>.force_name</code> is
<code>TRUE</code> then function IDs are provided in all situations.
</p>
<p>This can be useful in situation of grouping. As the functions are
evaluated independently within each group, there could be situations where
function outcomes are of length 1 for some groups and lenght 2 or more in
other groups.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list for every matrix in the matrixset object. Each list is itself a list.
For <code>apply_matrix</code>, it is a list of the function values - <code>NULL</code> if the matrix
was empty. Otherwise, it is a list with one element for each row/column -
these elements will be <code>NULL</code> if the corresponding matrix was empty. And
finally, for <code>apply_row</code>/<code>apply_column</code>, each of these sub-list is a list,
the results of each function.
</p>
<p>If each function returns a <code>vector</code> of the same dimension, you can use either
the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠_dfl⁠</code> or the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠_dfw⁠</code> version. What they do is to return a list of
<code>tibble</code>s. The <code>dfl</code> version will stack the function results in a long format
while the <code>dfw</code> version will put them side-by-side, in a wide format. An
empty matrix will be returned for empty input matrices.
</p>
<p>If the functions returned vectors of more than one element, there will be a
column to store the values and one for the function ID (dfl), or one column
per combination of function/result (dfw)
</p>
<p>See the grouping section to learn about the result format in the grouping
context.
</p>


<h3>Pronouns</h3>

<p>The <code>rlang</code> pronouns <code>.data</code> and <code>.env</code> are available. Two scenarios for
which they can be useful are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The annotation names are stored in a character variable. You can make use
of the variable by using <code>.data[[var]]</code>. See the example for an
illustration of this.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> You want to make use of a global variable that has the same name as an
annotation. You can use <code>.env[[var]]</code> or <code>.env$var</code> to make sure to use
the proper variable.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The matrixset package defines its own pronouns: .m, .i and .j, which
are discussed in the function specification argument (<code>...</code>).
</p>
<p>It is not necessary to import any of the pronouns (or load <code>rlang</code> in the
case of <code>.data</code> and <code>.env</code>) in a interactive session.
</p>
<p>It is useful however when writing a package to avoid the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠R CMD check⁠</code> notes.
As needed, you can import <code>.data</code> and <code>.env</code> (from <code>rlang</code>) or any of .m,
.i or .j from <code>matrixset</code>.
</p>


<h3>Multivariate</h3>

<p>The default behavior is to apply a function or expression to a single
matrix and each matrices of the <code>matrixset</code> object are provided sequentially
to the function/expression.
</p>
<p>If <code>.matrix_wise</code> is <code>FALSE</code>, all matrices are provided at once to the
functions/expressions. They can be provided in two fashions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> separately (default behavior). Each matrix can be referred by <code>.m1</code>, ...,
<code>.mn</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of matrices. Note that this is the number
as determined by <code>.matrix</code>.
</p>
<p>For <code>apply_row</code> (and dfl/dfw variants), use <code>.i1</code>, <code>.i2</code> and so on
instead. What the functions/expressions have access to in this case is
the first row of the first matrix, the first row of the second matrix
and so on. Then, continuing the loop, the second row of each matrix
will be accessible, and so on
</p>
<p>Similarly, use <code>.j1</code> and so on for the <code>apply_column</code> family.
</p>
<p>Anonymous functions will be understood as a function with multiple
arguments. In the example <code>apply_row(ms, mean, .matrix_wise = FALSE)</code>,
if there are 3 matrices in the <code>ms</code> object, <code>mean</code> is understood as
<code>mean(.i1, .i2, .i3)</code>. Note that this would fail because of the <code>mean</code>
function.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In a list (<code>.list_input = TRUE</code>). The list will have an element per matrix.
The list can be referred using the same pronouns (<code>.m</code>, <code>.i</code>, <code>.j</code>), and
the matrix, by the matrix names or position.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the multivariate setting, empty matrices are given as is, so it is
important that provided functions can deal with such a scenario. An
alternative is to skip the empty matrices with the <code>.matrix</code> argument.
</p>


<h3>Grouped matrixsets</h3>

<p>If groups have been defined, functions will be evaluated within them. When
both row and column grouping has been registered, functions are evaluated at
each cross-combination of row/column groups.
</p>
<p>The output format is different when the <code>.ms</code> matrixset object is grouped.
A list for every matrix is still returned, but each of these lists now holds
a tibble.
</p>
<p>Each tibble has a column called <code>.vals</code>, where the function results are
stored. This column is a list, one element per group. The group labels are
given by the other columns of the tibble. For a given group, things are like
the ungrouped version: further sub-lists for rows/columns - if applicable -
and function values.
</p>
<p>The dfl/dfw versions are more similar in their output format to their
ungrouped version. The format is almost identical, except that additional
columns are reported to identify the group labels.
</p>
<p>See the examples.
</p>
