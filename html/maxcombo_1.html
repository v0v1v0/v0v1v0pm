<h2>
The Group Sequential Max-Combo Test for Comparing Survival Curves
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains functions for comparing survival curves using the max-combo test at a single timepoint or repeatedly at successive respective timepoints while controlling type I error (i.e., the group sequential setting), as published by Tom Prior (Prior 2020 Group sequential monitoring based on the maximum of weighted log-rank statistics with the Fleming-Harrington class of weights in oncology clinical trials).  The max-combo test is a generalization of the weighted log-rank test, which itself is a generalization of the log-rank test, which is a commonly used statistical test for comparing survival curves, e.g., during or after a clinical trial as part of an effort to determine if a new drug or therapy is more effective at delaying undesirable outcomes than an established drug or therapy or a placebo.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package contains the following four functions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>oogetdoublemaxcomboteststatistic</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>oogetdoublemaxcombotestpvalue</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>oogetdoublemaxcombocutoff</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>oogetdoublemaxcombocutoffgroupsequential</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A reasonable way to get started with using this package is to read the documentation for those functions in the order they are listed above.
