<h2>mbRes: Exploration of Multiple Biomarker Responses using Effect Size</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Summarize multiple biomarker responses of aquatic organisms to contaminants
using Cliff’s delta, as described in Pham &amp; Sokolova (2023)
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ieam.4676">doi:10.1002/ieam.4676</a>.
</p>


<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p><code>mbr</code> and <code>visual</code> are the main
functions to compute and visualize Cliff’s delta and S-value which are
results of <code>cliff</code> and <code>resampling</code>.
<code>setpop</code>, <code>simul</code>, and <code>plotsam</code>
simulate and visualize a hypothetical dataset. <code>compare</code>
compares the results of Cliff’s delta and two other integrated indices
published earlier (i.e., RSI and IBR, see <code>blaise2002</code> and
<code>beliaeff2002</code>). The others (<code>ggheat</code> and
<code>ggdot</code>) are helper functions and are not meant to be called
directly by users.
</p>


<h3>Updates</h3>

<p><code>mbr.cliff</code> and <code>mbr.glass</code> simply
compute and visualize Cliff’s delta and Glass's delta.
