<h2> Large commercial risks in Asia-Pacific </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A completed project by the Insurance Risk and Finance Research Centre (www.IRFRC.com)
has assembled a unique dataset from Large Commercial Risk losses in
Asia-Pacific (APAC) covering the period 2000-2013.
The data was generously contributed by one global reinsurance company and two large Lloyd's
syndicates in London. This dataset is the result of the project co-lead by Dr Milidonis
(IRFRC and University of Cyprus) and Enrico Biffis (Imperial College Business School),
which can be referred to as the IRFRC LCR Dataset.
</p>
<p>As expected, the dataset is fully anonymized, as the LCR losses are aggregated along a
few dimensions. First, data is categorized based on the World Bank's economic development
classification. This means that losses either come from developed or developing
countries. The second dimension used to aggregate the data is the time period covered.
Data is grouped into (at least) two time-periods: the period before and after the 2008 crisis.
</p>
<p>A large commercial risk (LCR) is defined as a loss caused by man-made risks (e.g. fire, explosion, etc.).
We exclude natural catastrophe events, and started by focusing on claims that made the data provider
incur a loss amount of at least EUR 1 million. We then extended our dataset to include claims leading
to loss amounts smaller that EUR 1 million. Given time constraints, we only partially extended loss
data by obtaining FGU losses larger than EUR 140k. One should note that any selection bias arising
from the data collection exercise is driven by both data quality and reliability. Based on our
experience, the latter two attributes are homogeneous across developed and developing countries APAC claims.
