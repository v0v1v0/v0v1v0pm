<h2>Ireland wind data, 1961-1978</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Daily average wind speeds for 1961-1978 at 11 synoptic meteorological
stations in the Republic of Ireland (Haslett and raftery 1989). Wind speeds
are in m/s. De-trended data sets are also provided.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wind
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>wind</code>: a list containing a data.frame with 6574 rows and 12 columns,
and a list of locations.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data were obtained from the <strong>gstat</strong> package, and were modified so that
the first column is the time stamps. Locations of the 11 stations are given
in <code>wind_loc</code>. <code>wind_train</code> and <code>wind_test</code> contain de-trended and
square-root transformed train (1961-1970) and test (1971-1978) data sets.
See Gneiting et al. (2006) for de-trending details. <code>wind_trend</code> contains
the estimated annual trend and station-wise mean from the training dataset.
