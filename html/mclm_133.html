<h2>Retrieve the current ranks for frequency counts.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>ranks</code> retrieves from the ranks of its items in an object.
These ranks are integer values running from one up to the number of items
in <code>x</code>. Each items receives a unique rank.
Items are first ranked by frequency in descending order. Items with
identical frequency are further ranked by alphabetic order.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ranks(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'freqlist'
ranks(x, with_names = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of any of the classes for which the method is implemented.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>with_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Whether or not the items in the output should
be given names. If <code>TRUE</code>, then the names
of the types in the frequency list are used as names.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The mclm method <code>ranks()</code> is not
to be confused with <code>base::rank()</code>. There are two
important differences.
</p>
<p>First,<code>base::rank()</code> always ranks items from low values to
high values and <code>ranks()</code> ranks from high
frequency items to low frequency items.
</p>
<p>Second, <code>base::rank()</code> allows the user to choose among
a number of different ways to handle ties.
In contrast, <code>ranks()</code> always handles ties
in the same way. More specifically, items with identical frequencies
are always ranked in alphabetical order.
</p>
<p>In other words, <code>base::rank()</code> is a flexible tool that
supports a number of different ranking methods that are commonly used in
statistics. In contrast, <code>ranks()</code> is a
rigid tool that supports only one type of ranking, which is a type of
ranking that is atypical from a statistics point of view, but is commonly
used in linguistic frequency lists. Also, it is designed to be unaffected
by the order of the items in the frequency list.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Numeric vector representing the current ranks, with as its names
the types to which the ranks apply.
</p>

<p>Other getters and setters: 
<code>n_tokens()</code>,
<code>n_types()</code>,
<code>orig_ranks()</code>,
<code>tot_n_tokens()</code>,
<code>type_names()</code>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">(flist &lt;- freqlist("The man and the mouse.", as_text = TRUE))

orig_ranks(flist)
ranks(flist)
ranks(flist, with_names = TRUE)

(flist2 &lt;- keep_types(flist, c("man", "and")))

orig_ranks(flist2)
ranks(flist2)
</code></pre>
