<h2>Scan a character string from console</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The functions <code>scan_txt()</code> and <code>scan_txt2()</code>, which take no arguments,
can be used to scan a text string from the console.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">scan_txt()

scan_txt2()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>After the function call, R will continue scanning your input until it
encounters an empty input line, i.e. until it encounters two consecutive
newline symbols (or until it encounters a line with nothing but whitespace
characters). In other words, press ENTER twice in a row if you want to stop
inputting characters. The function will then return your input as a character vector
of length one.
</p>
<p>These functions are designed to allow you to input complex text, in particular
regular expressions, without dealing with the restrictions of string literals,
such as having to use <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠\\⁠</code> for <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠\⁠</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character vector of length one that contains the string that has
been scanned from the console.
</p>
