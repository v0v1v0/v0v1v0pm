<h2>Add structural vectors to a 0eigenchain, internal function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add structural (generalised) eigenvectors to a 0eigenchain, if possible.
These are vectors that do not depend on the  elements in the
non-trivial part of the mc matrix. In particular, their first mo.col
elements are zeroes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mc.0chain.structfill(mo, mo.col, chain, v0 = rep(0, mo))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> mo </code></td>
<td>
<p> mc order</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> mo.col </code></td>
<td>
<p> mc column order</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> chain </code></td>
<td>

<p>a matrix with the eigenvector in the first column and successive
generalised eigenvectors in the following columns.  A vector may
stand for a matrix with one column.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> v0 </code></td>
<td>
<p> vector to use as bottom of  the new vectors</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The size of the matrix is deduced from the length of the vector(s) in
<code>chain</code>.
</p>
<p>Structural chains associated with the zero eigenvalue appear when
<code>mo.col</code> is smaller than the dimension of the matrix. Such chains
do not depend on the actual values in the non-structural part of the
matrix. As such they are the same when the size, multi-companion order
and <code>mo.col</code> are fixed. If the  core of the matrix is singular
the structural chains do not describe  completely the space
associated with the zero eigenvalue.
</p>
<p>It is quite straight-forward to generate a structural chain associated
with a given eigenvector or to complete a partially given
chain. However, no attempt is made to check if the supplied chain may
indeed be the beginning of a structural chain.  Such a check is
straightforward but is not implemented since the function is internal
and is called  only by functions that know (hopefully) what they are
doing.
