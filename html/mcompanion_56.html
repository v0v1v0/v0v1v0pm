<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>mc_chains_triangulate</code> triangulates a set of chains to make it easier
to extend 0chains.
</p>
<p><code>chains</code> is a  list of chains for the 0 eigenvalue of
an mcmatrix. Each chain is represented by a matrix with the eigenvector
in the first column.
</p>
<p>For a multi-companion matrix the maximum number of chains for an
eigenvalue  is <code>mo</code>.
</p>
<p>Only the last <code>mo</code> elements of eigenvectors of mc matrices
corresponding to the zero eigenvalue may be non-zero.
</p>
<p><code>mc_chains_triangulate</code> triangulates the eigenvectors in the following
sense. Let <code class="reqn">i_1</code> be the first non-zero element of the first
eigenvector. Then the elements in position <code class="reqn">i_1</code> of the remaining
eigenvectors are made equal to zero by adding to them a multiple of
the first eigenvector. The corresponding transformation is done on
the remaining elements of the chains so that they remain proper
chains. Then the position, <code class="reqn">i_2</code>, of the first non-zero element of
the second eigenvector is found and the elements of the third and the
following eigenvectors at that position are made zero by adding to them a
multiple of the second eigenvector. The process is repeated until the
last eigenvector is reached.
</p>
<p>If <code>mo</code> is 4 and there are 4 chains, for example, then the above
procedure will typically transform the bottom <code class="reqn">4\times4</code> block of the
matrix obtained from the 4 eigenvectors into a lower triangular
matrix. If there are zero elements in the original bottom
<code class="reqn">4\times4</code> block, then the result will not be a lower triangular
matrix but the shape will be equivalent for the purposes of extending
the eigenvectors.
</p>
<p>todo: describe the above precisely in a separate document,
vzh. rakopisnite belezhki za izpolzvaniya algoritam.
</p>
<p>todo: it is probably worth to do this somewhat more elaborately for
numerical stability.
</p>
<p>todo: This function is not specific to zero eigenchains.
It can be used to put in canonic order any other eigenchain (but
check).
Change the name?
</p>
<p>todo: strictly speaking, for canonical order more is needed when there
are chains with the same heights.
