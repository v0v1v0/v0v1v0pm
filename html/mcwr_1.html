In the <code>mcwr</code> help entries, this
article will be referred to as "the paper" and its appendix as "the appendix".
</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The main function, which does the actual calculations, is <code>mcwr_expectancies</code>.
The other functions either check the data for consistency or
carry out data management tasks.
</p>
<p>Running mcwr demands a very specific data frame (called mcwr data frame, laid out in section ‘Data
setup’ below).  Several data management functions aide in creating such a specific data frame.
</p>
<p>The main data management function is <code>mcwr_genvars</code>, which generates p- and r- variables that are missing
from the data frame.  These variables specify transition probabilities and rewards.  Other data management
functions check the data frame for consistency (<code>mcwr_check</code>), transform variable names (<code>mcwr_switch</code>), or check or
create an exit row (<code>mcwr_exit</code>).

<dl>
<dt>MCWR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Markov chain with rewards</p>
</dd>
<dt>p-variables</dt>
<dd>
<p>Variables whose name is of the format 'p##'.  They contain transition
probability data.  The numbers encode from and target state.  The default for
this number pair is the ji-format (see below).  For example, variable 'p12'
has transition probabilities from-state 1 to state 2.</p>
</dd>
<dt>r-variables</dt>
<dd>
<p>Variables whose name is of the format 'r#_##'.  They contain rewards data.  The
first number encodes the state that receives the reward.  The second and third
numbers encode from and target state.  The default for this number pair is the
ji-format (see below).</p>
</dd>
<dt>ji/ij-format</dt>
<dd>
<p>Variable (names) are said to be in ji-format if the first number of the variable
name specifies the from-state and the second number specifies the target
state.  The index j always denotes the from-state.  Consequently, variable
(names) in ij-format state the target state first and then the from-state.</p>
</dd>
<dt>from/target/initial states</dt>
<dd>
<p>From-state and target state are the two states that are connected by a state
transition. The initial state is the state at baseline age.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mcwr data frame</dt>
<dd>
<p>A data frame that fulfills all requirements for mcwr to run on it without error.
The structure of the data frame is set forth in section Data setup.</p>

<h3>Data setup</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">mcwr</span> requires the transition data to be in a very specific format, called 'mcwr data frame' in this help entry.
To give you a quick idea of what is required, execute:
</p>
<pre>
data &lt;- mcwr_exampledata(1)
head(data)
tail(data)
</pre>
<p>In general, the following rules and conventions apply:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Transition probabilities are specified in p-variables.  The default convention for specifying from and
target states is the ji-format:  The first number encodes the from-state, the second number the target
state.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Rewards are specified in r-variables.  The numbers occuring in the variable names specify the rewarded
state, the from-state, and the target state, respectively.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A maximum number of 9 states (including the absorbing state) is allowed.  States must be encoded using
numbers 1-9. 0 is not allowed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Only a single absorbing state is allowed. It is encoded by the highest number occuring for all states. In
the example, 5 is the aborbing state.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> States can be non-contiguous. In the example, states 2 and 3 are missing from the model. The states of
the model are 1, 4, 5.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Transition probabilities must sum to 1. For example, columns p11, p14, p15 sum to 1.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> As long as the sums-to-unity condition is satisfied, not all p-variables must be present.  In the
example, variable p41 is missing, and all-zero by implication.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Age (or, more general, time) is specified in a variable called 'age'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Irregular age intervals are allowed. The Examples section illustrates this with a life table on a
'demographic' 5-year age grid (childhood age intervals are shorter).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The first row of the data frame specifies the baseline age. All p- and r-variables must have missing values
in the first row.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The last row of the data frame corresponds to the exit age. At this age, all subjects are required to die
(enter the absorbing state). In the example, variables p15 and p45 are set to 1 at age 111. All other
transitions at the exit age must be set to missing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> In general, whenever values of a mcwr data frame are certain to not enter matrix calculations, they must be
set to missing in the data frame. Conversely, data points that are certain to enter matrix calculations
must never be missing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The first transition takes place in row 2 (age 51 in the example).  It is important to keep in mind that
age specifies a point in time, not an interval.  It is the point in time when the subject turns 51.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> At this point, rewards can be distributed for the previous age (interval).  Standard Markov chain
calculations would distribute occupancy times end-of-period (the transition takes place at exact age 51).
By contrast, in the example we distribute time rewards and assume mid-period transitions, i.e. we assume
that state transitions take place at ages 50.5, 51.5, etc. The reward for state 1 of the 1-&gt;4 transition
at age 51 is specified to be 0.5. This covers the period [50 50.5).  The reward for state 4 of the 1-&gt;4
transition at age 51 is also specified to be 0.5. This covers the period [50.5 51). From the same logic,
staying in the same state carries a reward of 1. It is made up of rewards of 0.5 for each one of the
periods [50 50.5) and [50.5 51), respectively.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Rewards can only flow to from or target states.  For example, a variable 'r3_12' in the data frame will be
flagged as an error.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Rewards can only flow to transient states.  In the example, where the absorbing state is 5, a variable
'r5_45' will generate an error.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Rewards can take on any numeric value, including negative ones.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> You may have additional variables (variables other than p- and r-variables) in the data frame.  They will
be ignored.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a minor remark on the example data frame, it is derived from the SHARE application in the paper. In that
application, state 1 is left with certainty when turning 71, with no return possible.  The values shown in
the data frame for p14 and p15 for ages 71 and higher are therefore immaterial, given that this state is never
occupied at these ages.
</p>


<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>At the risk of redundancy, here are the limitations that <span class="pkg">mcwr</span> places on the model setup:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The maximum number of states is 9 (including the absorbing state).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Only a single absorbing state is allowed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Rewards can only flow to from or target states.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Object design</h3>

<p>We implemented <span class="pkg">mcwr</span> using plain data frames. The input argument to all 
package functions is a data frame, as opposed to a specialized S3 object.
We did so on purpose, since an S3 object here provides only moderate gains
and yet complicates things in some respects.
This design decision may change in the future,
so the current <code>mcwr_*()</code> function names
may change (e.g., <code>mcwr_check()</code> will turn into <code>check()</code>).
However, the <code>mcwr_*()</code> functions are guaranteed to continue to work 
in the future in order to ensure backward compatibility.
</p>


<h3>Life tables and open age intervals</h3>

<p>The last age group of life tables is frequently an open interval.  What does this mean for mcwr data frames?
In the present context, the important thing to recognize is that mcwr expectancies must have access to the
proper ax value (Chiangs a).  The best way to achieve this is to set exit age (certain transition into
death) to some number greater than the previous age.  It does not really matter which age you choose as long
as you assign the ax value to the correct rewards variable.  The Examples section below illustrates this.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## The first example uses a subset of the data from the retirement
## example in the paper.  The example data frame
## only contains transition variables.  We verify that the data frame
## is suitable for mcwr and gather some model information.

ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_exampledata(1)
ex_modelinfo &lt;- mcwr_check(ex_dat)
names(ex_modelinfo)
ex_modelinfo$s_frm
ex_modelinfo$s_abs
ex_modelinfo$numages

## modelinfo$s_frm tells us that the from-states are 1 2 4,
## and modelinfo$s_abs indicates 5 to be the absorbing state.
## There are 61 age classes in the model, which we can see
## from modelinfo$numages.  Given initial proportions, we
## can immediately calculate expectancies with different timing assumptions:

ex_init &lt;- c(0.95, 0.04, 0.01)
names(ex_init) &lt;- c(1,2,4)
mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat, timing='mid', initprop=ex_init)[[1]]
mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat, timing='eop', initprop=ex_init)[[1]]

## Since we have a regular age grid of 1, the corresponding
## magnitudes in the 'end-of-period' specification
## are higher by 0.5. The output also tells us that total
## life expectancy does not depend on the initial
## state and that some occupation times are zero.
## This comes from the particular data restrictions and
## assumptions of the application in the paper:
## Mortality does not differ across states, and transitions
## from state 4 (retirement) to states 1 (working) or
## 2 (unemployed) never occur (by assumption). See the
## paper for more details.
##
## Since we are talking about the meaning of the state encodings:
## Let's label the numeric values with meaningful descriptions.
## This can be done via the vllmap option:

ex_MCWR &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)
names(ex_MCWR) &lt;- c('work', 'unem', 'oolf', 'retr', 'dead')
mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat, timing='eop', initprop=ex_init, vllmap=ex_MCWR)[[1]]

## Let's now assume that retirement occurs on average
## 3 months into the retirement year. The easiest way to
## specify this is to generate all rewards variables first
## as mid period and then edit them as needed:

ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_genvars(ex_dat, timing='mid', order=TRUE)
names(ex_dat)
ex_dat[2:(nrow(ex_dat)-1),'r1_14'] &lt;- 0.25
ex_dat[2:(nrow(ex_dat)-1),'r4_14'] &lt;- 0.75
ex_dat[2:(nrow(ex_dat)-1),'r2_24'] &lt;- 0.25
ex_dat[2:(nrow(ex_dat)-1),'r4_24'] &lt;- 0.75

## We do not have to worry about transitions out
## of retirement since their probability is zero.
## 
## At this point it is useful to look at the data. In particular,
## take note of how the first and last few rows are structured.

head(ex_dat)
tail(ex_dat)

## We recalculate:

mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat, initprop=ex_init, vllmap=ex_MCWR)[[1]]

## As an alternative to the above data replacement statements,
## we could have solely used function mcwr_genvars() in
## conjunction with the timing option of mcwr_expectancies().
## This has the advantage of not having to worry
## about getting the baseline and exit age rows right
## (the row-indexing part of the statements).

ex_dat[,grep('r._..', names(ex_dat))] &lt;- NULL
ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_genvars(ex_dat, timing=0.25, order=TRUE)
ex_getn &lt;- function(pat) grep(pat, names(ex_dat), value=TRUE)
ex_keepvars &lt;- c('age', ex_getn('p..'), ex_getn('r._14'), ex_getn('r._24'))
ex_dat &lt;- ex_dat[,ex_keepvars]
mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat, initprop=ex_init, vllmap=ex_MCWR, timing='mid', add=TRUE)[[1]]

## After the creation of the 'timing(0.25)' rewards variables,
## we could have generated the remaining rewards variables explicitly:

ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_genvars(ex_dat, timing='mid', add=TRUE, order=TRUE)
mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat, initprop=ex_init, vllmap=ex_MCWR)[[1]]

## Next, we illustrate the equivalence to standard life table
## calculations. We first look at a regularly spaced 1-year life table.

ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_exampledata(2)
names(ex_dat)

## Checking whether we have a proper mcwr data frame reveals problems:

junk &lt;- try(ex_modelinfo &lt;- mcwr_check(ex_dat)) # generates error

## We look at the beginning and ending rows of the data frame:

head(ex_dat)
tail(ex_dat)

## We see that a number of mcwr data requirements, in particular
## those concerning the first and last row of the data
## frame, are not met. The data in proper mcwr format look like this:

ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_exampledata(6)
head(ex_dat)
tail(ex_dat)

## The correct life table value for e0 is 80.16.
## Mid-period mcwr calculations yield

mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat, timing='mid')[[1]]

## This ignores the values in the ax variable, which are different
## from 0.5 for the first and last age. We take them
## into account be generating an r-variable with corresponding values.

ex_dat[,'r1_12'] &lt;- ex_dat[,'ax']
mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat, timing='mid', add=TRUE)[[1]]

## The result is a little more accurate than the previous calculation.
## 
## Let's look at the corresponding 5-year life table.

ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_exampledata(3)
junk &lt;- try(modelinfo &lt;- mcwr_check(ex_dat)) # generates error
head(ex_dat)
tail(ex_dat)

## The data set must again be first transformed to a valid mcwr data set.
## It then looks like:

ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_exampledata(7)
head(ex_dat)
tail(ex_dat)

## We again perform calculations with and without taking ax into account:

mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat, timing='mid')[[1]]

ex_dat[,'r1_12'] &lt;- ex_dat[,'ax']
ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_genvars(ex_dat, timing='mid', add=TRUE, order=TRUE)
ex_dat &lt;- mcwr_expectancies(ex_dat)[[1]]

ex_dat

## We explicitly created all rewards variables using mcwr_genvars()
## instead of using them implicitly in mcwr_expectancies().
## We did this to illustrate how mcwr uses rewards to
## handle irregularly spaced age intervals.
