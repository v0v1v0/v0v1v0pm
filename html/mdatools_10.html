Raman spectra of carbonhydrates
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset consists of Raman spectra of fructose, lactose, and ribose as well as spectra of their
mixtures.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data is a list (<code>carbs</code>) with the following fields:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">
    <code>$D</code> </td>
<td style="text-align: left;"> a matrix (21x1401) with spectral values for the mixtures. </td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: right;">
    <code>$C</code> </td>
<td style="text-align: left;"> a matrix (21x3) with concentration of the pure components. </td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset consists of Raman spectra of fructose, lactose, and ribose as well as spectra of their
mixtures. The original spectra were downloaded from publicly available SPECARB library [1], created
by S.B. Engelsen. The specta were truncated to the range from 200 to 1600 cm-1.
</p>
<p>The spectra of mixtures were created by linear combinations of the original spectra:
</p>
<p>D = CS' + E
</p>
<p>Concentrations of the components, C, follow a simplex lattice design with four levels. Some noise calculated as a random number uniformly distributed between 0% and 3% of maximum initial intensity (E) was added to each spectrum of the dataset, D, individually.
