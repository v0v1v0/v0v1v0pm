<h2>Rat Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data set presented by Mantel, et al. (1977) is based on a tumorigenesis
study of 50 litters of female rats. For each litter, one rat was
selected to receive the drug and the other two rats were placebo-treated
controls. Here each litter is treated as a cluster. The survival
time is the time to development of tumor, measured in weeks.
Death before occurrence of tumor yields a right-censored observation;
forty rats developed a tumor, leading to censoring of about 73 percent.
