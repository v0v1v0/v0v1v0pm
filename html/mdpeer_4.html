<h2>mdpeer: Methods for graph-constrained regression with enhanced regularization parameters selection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides graph-constrained
regression methods in which regularization parameters 
are selected automatically via estimation of equivalent Linear
Mixed Model formulation.  
'riPEER' (ridgified Partially Empirical Eigenvectors for
Regression) method employs a penalty term being
a linear combination of graph-originated and ridge-originated penalty terms,
whose two regularization parameters are ML estimators from corresponding Linear
Mixed Model solution; a graph-originated penalty
term allows imposing similarity between coefficients based on graph information
given whereas additional ridge-originated penalty term facilitates parameters
estimation: it reduces computational issues arising from singularity in a graph-originated 
penalty matrix and yields plausible results in situations when graph
information is not informative. 'riPEERc' (ridgified Partially Empirical Eigenvectors for
Regression with constant) method utilizes addition of a diagonal matrix multiplied by a predefined (small) 
scalar to handle the non-invertibility of a graph Laplacian matrix. 'vrPEER' 
(variable reducted PEER) method performs variable-reduction procedure to handle 
the non-invertibility of a graph Laplacian matrix.
