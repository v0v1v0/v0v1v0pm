<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Ballot information for the 2013 Minneapolis Mayoral election, which was run
as a rank-choice election.  In rank-choice, a voter can indicate first,
second, and third choices.  If a voter's first choice is eliminated (by
being last in the count across voters), the second choice is promoted to
that voter's first choice, and similarly third -&gt; second.  Eliminations are
done successively until one candidate has a majority of the first-choice
votes.
