<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Almost all of the members of parliament belongs to a political party. This table
identifies that party. These data were provided by Caroline Ettinger and form part of her
senior honor's project at Macalester College. Prof. Andrew Beveridge supervised the
thesis. Ms. Ettinger used the vote data to explore how to extract the party association
of members purely from voting records. The Parties data was used to evaluate
the success of methods.
