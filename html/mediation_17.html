<h2>Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis for Multiple Causal Mechanisms</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>'multimed' is used for causal mediation analysis when post-treatment 
mediator-outcome confounders, or alternative mediators causally preceding the
mediator of interest, exist in the hypothesized causal mechanisms. It 
estimates the average causal mediation effects (indirect effects) and the 
average direct effects under the homogeneous interaction assumption based on 
a varying-coefficient linear structural equation model. The function also 
performs sensitivity analysis with respect to the violation of the homogenous
interaction assumption. The function can be used for both the single
experiment design and the parallel design.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function implements the framework proposed by Imai and Yamamoto
(2012) for the estimation and sensitivity analysis for multiple causal
mechanisms. It estimates the average causal mediation effects (indirect
effects) with respect to the mediator of interest ('med.main'), i.e., the
portion of the treatment effect on the outcome that is transmitted through
that mediator, as well as the average direct effects, i.e., the portion of
the treatment effect on the outcome that is not transmitted through the
main mediator. Unlike the "standard" causal mediation analysis implemented
by <code>mediate</code> and <code>medsens</code>, this framework allows
the existence of post-treatment covariates that confound the relationship 
between the main mediator and the outcome, or equivalently, alternative 
mediators ('med.alt') that causally precede the main mediator.
</p>
<p>When the parallel design was used for the experiment (i.e. when the 
experiment contained an additional randomly assigned group for which both 
the treatment and the mediator were randomized), there is no need to
specify a particular post-treatment confounder, for any such confounder
(observed or unobserved) is allowed to exist by virtue of the design.
Similarly, no observed covariates need to be included. The function instead
requires an additional variable ('experiment') indicating whether the
mediator was randomly manipulated for the unit.
</p>
<p>The estimation and sensitivity analysis are both based on a 
varying-coefficient linear structural equations model, which assumes 
additivity but allows for an arbitrary degree of heterogeneity in model 
coefficients across units and thus is substantially more flexible than a 
traditional SEM framework. For details see Imai and Yamamoto (2012).
</p>
<p>The function produces two sets of results. First, point estimates of the 
average causal mediation effects and the average direct effects are 
calculated, along with their (percentile) bootstrap confidence intervals. 
These estimates are based on the "homogeneous interaction" assumption, or 
the assumption that the degree of treatment-mediator interaction is
constant across all units. The estimated total treatment effect is also
reported.
</p>
<p>Second, the bounds on the average causal mediation effects and the average 
direct effects are also estimated and computed for various degrees of 
interaction heterogeneity (i.e., violation of the identification 
assumption), which are represented by the values of three alternative 
sensitivity parameters. These parameters are: (1) sigma, the standard 
deviation of the (varying) regression coefficient on the interaction term, 
(2) R square star, the proportion of the residual variance that would be 
explained by an additional term for interaction heterogeneity, and (3) R 
square tilde, the proportion of the total variance explained by such a
term. The confidence region is also calculated, using the Imbens and Manski
(2004) formula with bootstrap standard errors. Further details are given in
the above reference.
</p>
<p>Note that rows with missing values will be omitted from the calculation of 
the results. Also note that the treatment variable must be a numeric vector
of 1 and 0 and that both mediators and outcome variable must be numeric.
The pre-treatment covariates can be of any type that <code>lm</code> can
handle as predictors.
