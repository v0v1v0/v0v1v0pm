<h2>Run memery example app</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Launch the memery example app in your browser.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">memeApp()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This example app launches with animated gif support and relevant initial
example gif if the magick package is installed. Otherwise, a simplified
version of the app that does not provide gif support launches and starting
images must be jpg or png.
</p>
<p>Due to how <code>meme_gif()</code> works, gifs will not display in a hosted app, i.e.,
on <code>shinyapps.io</code>. Memes based on gifs with many frames also take longer to
render. By default, the app is set to render any animated gif input into a
static meme using only the first frame in the animated gif. If it takes one
second to render a single frame, expect it to take about 43 seconds to render
the 43-frame example animated gif that comes preloaded in the app. If the user
wishes to wait, the input control menu for output frames can be switched from
first frame to all frames.
</p>
<p>While <code>jpg</code> and <code>png</code> memes will display in a hosted app like on <code>shinyapps.io</code>,
the impact font will also not likely be available on a given server. For all
these reasons this packaged app is not hosted elsewhere. The best and
intended experience is to use the app locally via the <code>memery</code> package.
</p>
<p>All ggplot objects that exist in the global environment when the app is
launched propagate a selection menu in app for use as inset plots to overlay
meme image backgrounds. If there are no ggplot objects in the global
environment, one named <code>memery_testplot()</code> will be created within the app
environment and will appear in the selection menu instead.
</p>
<p>A meme can be saved from an app by right-clicking on the image in your web
browser and selecting the save option just like with any other web images.
</p>
