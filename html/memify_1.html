<h2>
A Simple Framework to Construct and Maintain Functions That Keep State
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides a simple way to construct and maintain versions of R functions that keep their state – i.e. "remember" their explicitly specifed arguments from previous calls. If not overridden, the remembered values of these arguments are automatically reused as the defaults for subsequent calls.
</p>
<p>This may be convenient when a function with a large argument list – plotting functions are typical examples – needs to be repeatedly invoked with only a few changes in the arguments at each invocation; or when interacting with a function to determine what parameter values give the most informative results. While there are certainly other ways to do this, the simplicity of this approach may make it a useful alternative.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package has only one key function: <code>memify()</code>. It takes one argument, <code>f</code>, a function or a function name as a name/symbol or character string. The result, almost always assigned to a different name, is a new version of <code>f</code> that will keep state. It has S3 class <code>"memified"</code> that extends the function's original class vector . The original version of <code>f</code> of course remains.
</p>
<p>Some minor additional convenience functions, <code>arglist()</code>, <code>arglist(x) &lt;- value</code>, and an update method, <code>update.memified()</code>, are also provided. See the examples here and in their repective Help pages for usage.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The <em>arglist</em> of a memified function consists only of arguments that were explicitly specified in a prior call. Hence, any formal default arguments that were not changed or specified will not be included in the memified function's arglist, which can be extracted via the <code>arglist()</code> function.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mod &lt;- function(x, b = 5) x %% b
mod.m &lt;- memify(mod) ## or memify("mod")
mod.m(7) ## using default b = 5
mod.m(b = 3) ## using remembered x = 7
mod.m()  ## the same as previous

arglist(mod.m) ## list of all memified arguments
update (mod.m, b = 9) ## silently updates arglist
arglist(mod.m)

arglist(mod.m) &lt;- list(x=11) ## replaces the arglist with a new list
arglist(mod.m)
## b is no longer memified, so mod's default = 5 is used:
mod.m()

## cleanup
rm(mod.m)
</code></pre>
