<h2>Named Lists, Lists of Items, and Atomic Vectors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The classes "named.list" and "item.list" are merely some
'helper classes' for the construction of the classes "data.set"
and "importer".
</p>
<p>Class "named.list" extends the basic class "list" by an additional
slot "names". Its <code>initialize</code> method assures that the names
of the list are unique.
</p>
<p>Class "item.list" extends the class "named.list", but does not
add any slots. From "named.list" it differs only by the 
<code>initialize</code> method, which calls that for "named.list"
and makes sure that all elements of the list belong to 
class "item".
</p>
<p>Classes "atomic" and "double" are merely used for
method selection.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">new("named.list",a=1,b=2)

# This should generate an error, since the names
# are not unique.
try(new("named.list",a=1,a=2))

# Another error, one name is missing.
try(new("named.list",a=1,2))

# Also an error, the resulting list would be unnamed.
try(new("named.list",1,2))


new("item.list",a=1,b=2)

# Also an error: "item.list"s are "named.lists",
# and here the names would be non-unique.
try(new("item.list",a=1,a=2))
</code></pre>
