<h3>Description</h3>

<p>'basic_cache' makes a cache that does not expire old entries.
It should be used in situations where you know the number of
things to remember is bounded.
</p>
<p>Construct a cache with least-recently-used policy.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">permanent_cache()

lru_cache(size = 10000)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>size</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of results to keep.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A function f(key, value) which takes a string in the first
parameter and a lazily evaluated value in the second. 'f'
will use the string key to retrieve a value from the cache, or
return the matching item from the cache, or force the second
argument and return that, remembering the result on future calls.
</p>
<p>When the number of entries in the cache exceeds <code>size</code>, the least
recently accessed entries are removed.
