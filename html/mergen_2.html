<h2>Clean code blocks returned by the agent</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function cleans up the response
returned by the agent to ensure code blocks
can run. It ensures that characters such as
'R' and 'r' are cleaned from code blocks in the agents
response, so that the code blocks are able to be extracted by
the extractCode() function and ran as expected. It also cleans
the response from any install.package calls, and recorded output,
so that when code blocks are extracted, the code can run smoothly.
</p>
