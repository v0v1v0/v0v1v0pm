<h2>A flexible date class for messy dates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Recent extensions to standardised date notation in
<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/70908.html">ISO 8601-2_2019(E)</a>
create space for unspecified, uncertain, and approximate dates,
as well as succinct representation of ranges of dates.
These functions create and validate a new date class for R
that can contain and parse these annotations,
and are not typically user-facing.
Please see <code>as_messydate()</code> for the user-facing coercion function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">new_messydate(x = character())

validate_messydate(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character scalar or vector in the expected <code>"yyyy-mm-dd"</code> format
annotated, as necessary, according to ISO 8601-2_2019(E).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>



<h4>Date annotations</h4>

<p><em>Unspecified date components</em>, such as when the day is unknown,
can be represented by one or more <code>X</code>s in place of the digits.
The modifier <code>*</code> is recommended to indicate that the entire
time scale component value is unspecified, e.g. <code>X*-03-03</code>,
however this is not implemented here.
Please be explicit about the digits that are unspecified,
e.g. <code>XXXX-03-03</code> expresses 3rd March in some unspecified year,
whereas <code>2003-XX-03</code> expresses the 3rd of some month in 2003.
If time components are not given, they are expanded to this.
</p>
<p><em>Approximate date components</em>, modified by <code>~</code>,
represent an estimate whose value is asserted
to be possibly correct.
For example, <code>2003~-03-03</code>
The degree of confidence in approximation
depends on the application.
</p>
<p><em>Uncertain date components</em>, modified by <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠?⁠</code>,
represent a date component whose source is considered
to be dubious and therefore not to be relied upon.
An additional modifier, <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠%⁠</code>, is used to indicate
a value that is both uncertain and approximate.
</p>



<h4>Date sets</h4>

<p>These functions also introduce standard notation
for ranges of dates.
Rather than the typical R notation for ranges,
<code>:</code>, ISO 8601-2_2019(E) recommends <code>..</code>.
This then can be applied between two time scale
components to create a standard range between
these dates (inclusive), e.g. <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠2009-01-01..2019-01-01⁠</code>.
But it can also be used as an affix,
indicating "on or before" if used as a prefix,
e.g. <code>..2019-01-01</code>,
or indicating "on or after" if used as a suffix,
e.g. <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠2009-01-01..⁠</code>.
</p>
<p>And lastly, notation for sets of dates is also included.
Here braces, <code>{}</code>, are used to mean "all members of the set",
while brackets, <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[]⁠</code>, are used to mean "one member of the set".
