<h2>Expand messy dates to lists of dates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions expand on date ranges, sets of dates, and unspecified or
approximate dates (annotated with '..', '', 'XX' or '~').
As these messydates may refer to several possible dates,
the function "opens" these values to reveal a vector of all the possible
dates implied.
Imprecise dates (dates only containing information on year and/or month)
are also expanded to include possible dates within that year and/or month.
The function removes the annotation from dates with unreliable sources ('?'),
before being expanded normally as though they were incomplete.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">expand(x, approx_range = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>mdate</code> object.
If not an 'mdate' object, conversion is handled first with ´as_messydate()´.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>approx_range</code></td>
<td>
<p>Range to expand approximate dates,
or date components, annotated with '~', by default 0.
That is, removes signs for approximate dates and
treats these dates as precise dates.
If 3, for example, adds 3 days for day approximation,
3 months for month approximation,
3 years for year/whole date approximation,
3 years and 3 months for year-month approximation,
and 3 months and 3 days for month-day approximation.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of dates, including all dates in each range or set.
