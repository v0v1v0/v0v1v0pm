<h2>Calculates SMD from Matched Groups</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the standardized mean differences for matched groups. Needs either the mean of the groups or the difference between groups.
SD_within is usually not reported but can be calculated by the use of <code>SD_within_from_SD_r()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SMD_from_mean_matched(M_diff = NA, M1 = NA, M2 = NA, SD_within)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>M_diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>mean difference between groups</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>M1</code></td>
<td>
<p>mean group 1 (in case M_diff not provided)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>M2</code></td>
<td>
<p>mean group 2 (in case M_diff not provided)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SD_within</code></td>
<td>
<p>within standard deviation. CAVE this is usually not reported but needs to be computed from the difference standard deviation.
This can be done with <code>SD_within_from_SD_r()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Standardized Mean Differences
