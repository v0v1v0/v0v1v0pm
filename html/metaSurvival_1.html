<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The survival probabilities were extracted from the published survival curves each month during the first six months and then by step of three months. The pictures of the curves were digitalized using the R package ReadImage and the probabilities were extracted using the package digitize proposed by Poisot. The numbers of at-risk patients for each interval of time were derived from the numbers of at-risk patients reported in the studies, and using the methods of Parmar or Williamson to account for censorship. Studies have different length of follow-up. For each study, survival probabilities and the numbers of at-risk patients were collected at all points in time before the end of follow-up.
