<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function can be used to calculate the ‘fail-safe N’, that is, the minimum number of studies averaging null results that would have to be added to a given set of \(k\) studies to change the conclusion of a meta-analysis. If this number is small (in relation to the actual number of studies), then this indicates that the results based on the observed studies are not robust to publication bias (of the form assumed by the method, that is, where a set of studies averaging null results is missing). The method is also called a ‘file drawer analysis’ as it assumes that there is a set of studies averaging null results hiding in file drawers, which can overturn the findings from a meta-analysis. There are various types of methods that are all based on the same principle, which are described in more detail further below. Note that <em>the fail-safe N is not an estimate of the number of missing studies</em>, only how many studies must be hiding in file drawers for the findings to be overturned.
</p>
<p>One can either pass a vector with the observed effect sizes or outcomes (via <code>x</code>) and the corresponding sampling variances via <code>vi</code> (or the standard errors via <code>sei</code>) to the function or an object of class <code>"rma"</code>. When passing a model object, the model must be a model without moderators (i.e., either an equal- or a random-effects model).
</p>


<h4>Rosenthal Method</h4>

<p>The Rosenthal method (<code>type="Rosenthal"</code>) calculates the minimum number of studies averaging null results that would have to be added to a given set of studies to reduce the (one-tailed) combined significance level (i.e., p-value) to a particular alpha level, which can be specified via the <code>alpha</code> argument (.05 by default). The calculation is based on Stouffer's method for combining p-values and is described in Rosenthal (1979). Note that the method is primarily of interest for historical reasons, but the other methods described below are more closely aligned with the way meta-analyses are typically conducted in practice.
</p>



<h4>Orwin Method</h4>

<p>The Orwin method (<code>type="Orwin"</code>) calculates the minimum number of studies averaging null results that would have to be added to a given set of studies to reduce the (unweighted or weighted) average effect size / outcome to a target value (as specified via the <code>target</code> argument). The method is described in Orwin (1983). When <code>vi</code> (or <code>sei</code>) is not specified, the method is based on the unweighted average of the effect sizes / outcomes; otherwise, the method uses the inverse-variance weighted average. If the <code>target</code> argument is not specified, then the target value will be equal to the observed average effect size / outcome divided by 2 (which is entirely arbitrary and will always lead to a fail-safe N number that is equal to \(k\)). One should really set <code>target</code> to a value that reflects an effect size / outcome that would be considered to be practically irrelevant. Note that if <code>target</code> has the opposite sign as the actually observed average, then its sign is automatically flipped.
</p>



<h4>Rosenberg Method</h4>

<p>The Rosenberg method (<code>type="Rosenberg"</code>) calculates the minimum number of studies averaging null results that would have to be added to a given set of studies to reduce the significance level (i.e., p-value) of the average effect size / outcome (as estimated based on an equal-effects model) to a particular alpha level, which can be specified via the <code>alpha</code> argument (.05 by default). The method is described in Rosenberg (2005). Note that the p-value is calculated based on a standard normal distribution (instead of a t-distribution, as suggested by Rosenberg, 2005), but the difference is typically negligible.
</p>



<h4>General Method</h4>

<p>This method is a generalization of the methods by Orwin and Rosenberg. By default (i.e., when <code>target</code> is not specified), it calculates the minimum number of studies averaging null results that would have to be added to a given set of studies to reduce the significance level (i.e., p-value) of the average effect size / outcome (as estimated based on a chosen model) to a particular alpha level, which can be specified via the <code>alpha</code> argument (.05 by default). The type of model that is used in the calculation is chosen via the <code>method</code> argument. If this is unspecified, then a random-effects model is automatically used (using <code>method="REML"</code>) or the method that was used in fitting the <code>"rma"</code> model (see <code>rma.uni</code> for options). Therefore, when setting <code>method="EE"</code>, then an equal-effects model is used, which yields (essentially) identical results as Rosenberg's method.
</p>
<p>If <code>target</code> is specified, then the method calculates the minimum number of studies averaging null results that would have to be added to a given set of studies to reduce the average effect size / outcome (as estimated based on a chosen model) to a target value (as specified via the <code>target</code> argument). As described above, the type of model that is used in the calculation is chosen via the <code>method</code> argument. When setting <code>method="EE"</code>, then an equal-effects model is used, which yields (essentially) identical results as Orwin's method with inverse-variance weights.
</p>
<p>The method uses an iterative algorithm for calculating the fail-safe N, which can be computationally expensive especially when N is large. By default, the method uses approximate (but faster) calculations, but when setting <code>exact=TRUE</code>, the method uses exact (but slower) calculations. The difference between the two is typically negligible. If N is larger than \(10^7\), then the calculated number is given as <code>&gt;1e+07</code>.

<h3>Note</h3>
