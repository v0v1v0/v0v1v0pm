<h2>Data: General Knowledge Statements</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Martinie et al. (2020) recruited individuals on Amazon Mechanical Turk and asked them to provide subjective probabilities
of whether various general science statements from U.S. grade school were true or false. 
Problems were classified into five levels of difficulty, with level 1 being the easiest and level 5 being the most difficult. 
For example, one easy problem (level 1) presented the statement <em>Omnivores only eat meat</em>, whereas one 
difficult problem (level 5) presented the statement <em>Sound waves and electromagnetic waves 
are examples of longitudinal waves</em>. 
</p>
<p>The full data have been split into 5 groups based on the difficulty the questions.
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>E_GK_1</code> to <code>E_GK_5</code>: A list of the judges' estimates of the probabilities 
that the statements are true. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>P_GK_1</code> to <code>P_GK_5</code>: A list of the judges' predictions of others' average probability estimates. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ID_GK_1</code> to <code>ID_GK_5</code>: A list of the judges' identification numbers. 
These values make it possible to track a judge across different judgment tasks. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>THETA_GK_1</code> to <code>THETA_GK_5</code>: Actual outcomes showing whether the statements are true (1) or not (0).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The final number in the name of the data set indicates the associated difficulty level.
For instance, <code>E_GK_5</code> holds the probability estimates of the most difficult questions, 
<code>THETA_GK_1</code> holds actual outcomes for the easiest questions, and so on.
The elements of each list correspond to the same question. For instance, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th elements
of <code>THETA_GK_1</code>, <code>E_GK_1</code>, <code>P_GK_1</code>, and <code>ID_GK_1</code> give
the true outcome, vector of probability estimates, vector of predictions of other judges' average probability estimates, 
and vector of identification numbers of the <code class="reqn">j</code>th question with difficulty level 1.
