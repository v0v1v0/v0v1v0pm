<h2>Calculate the Influence Scores</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes and plots the influence scores described in <em>Palley &amp; Satopää (2021):
Boosting the Wisdom of Crowds Within a Single Judgment Problem: Weighted Averaging Based on Peer Predictions</em>.
The current version of the paper is available at <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=3504286">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=3504286</a>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_influence_scores(E, P, plotIt = FALSE, cutoff = 7/2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>E</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of <code class="reqn">J \ge 6</code> estimates of the outcome.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>P</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of <code class="reqn">J \ge 6</code> predictions of others. The values must be in the same order as the estimates in <code>E</code>.
Specifically, for all <code class="reqn">j = 1, ..., J</code>, <code>E[j]</code> and <code>P[j]</code> give the <code class="reqn">j</code>th judge's estimate and prediction of others, respectively.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plotIt</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean value. If TRUE, then the function call produces two side-by-side plots:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Left plot: This is a scatter plot of the judges' estimates against the judges' implied predictions of others. 
This plot includes regression lines both with (solid black) and without (dashed red) the exceptionally influential judges.
All exceptionally influential judges are shown in red. 
The knowledge-weighted estimate is shown both with (black square) and without (red circle) exceptionally influential judges.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Right plot: This shows the judges' influence scores. 
All exceptionally influential judges are shown in red. 
The dashed horizontal line represents the threshold, defined as the user-defined <code>cutoff</code> value x the
interquartile range of all influence scores. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cutoff</code></td>
<td>
<p>A positive scalar describing the cutoff value for the outlier-robust knowledge-weighted estimate. 
The outlier-robust version calculates the influence scores for all 
judges. Each influence score is then compared against <code>cutoff</code> x the
interquartile range of all influence scores. If a judge's influence score is above this quantity, then that judge is 
deemed exceptionally influential. This parameter only has an effect if <code>plotIt</code> has been set to TRUE.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code class="reqn">J</code> vector of influence scores. Intuitively, the influence score of a judge represents the amount by which the 
knowledge-weighted estimate would change if that judge was removed from the crowd. Judges with an exceptionally 
high influence should be inspected. As a default cutoff value, the authors recommend <code class="reqn">7/2</code> times the interquartile range
of the individual judges' influence scores.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Illustration on the Three Gorges Dam Example in Palley &amp; Satopää (2021):

# The original example with 6 judges is augmented with a 7th judge with an extreme response.
# Judges' estimates:
E2 = c(50, 134, 206, 290, 326, 374, 1000)
# Judges' predictions of others
P2 = c(26, 92, 116, 218, 218, 206, 400)

# The influence score of the 7th judge is much higher than the other judges' scores.
# This judge's response should be inspected and potentially excluded from
# the final knowledge-weighted estimate.
