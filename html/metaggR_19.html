<h2>Data: Calorie Counts</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Palley and Satop채채 (2021) conducted an experiment where participants were presented with 36 different pictures
of food from different restaurants and were asked to estimate the total number of calories in these dishes.
Each response involves three steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><strong>Initial Estimates:</strong> On the first screen the participant was presented with a picture of a meal
and asked <em>How many calories do you think are in this meal?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Predictions of Others:</strong> On the second screen the participant saw the same
picture, was reminded of their previous estimate, and given the statement:
<em>We will be showing this picture to other participants as well. Just as we did with
you, we will ask them how many calories they believe are in this meal.</em>
The participant was then asked to predict <em>How many calories do you think that others
will guess on average?</em>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Final Estimates:</strong> On the third screen the participant saw the same picture again
and was asked <em>After having reflected on others, what is
your own final best estimate of the number of calories in this meal?</em>
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Format</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>E_CALORIES_INITIAL</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of the judges' initial estimates of the calorie counts in each of the 36 meals.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of the judges' initial estimates of the calories in the <code class="reqn">j</code>th meal.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>E_CALORIES_FINAL</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of the judges' final estimates of the calorie counts in each of the 36 meals.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of the judges' final estimates of the calories in the <code class="reqn">j</code>th meal.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>P_CALORIES</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of the judges' predictions of others.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of the judges' predictions of other judges' average
estimate of the number of calories in the <code class="reqn">j</code>th meal.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>THETA_CALORIES</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a vector of the true calorie counts in each of the 36 meals.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is the true calorie count in the <code class="reqn">j</code>th meal.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>ID_CALORIES</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of the judges' identification numbers in each of the 36 meals.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of identification numbers of judges' who gave responses 
for the <code class="reqn">j</code>th meal. These values make it possible to track a judge across questions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Remark.</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The elements of each list correspond to the same meal. Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th elements of 
<code>THETA_CALORIES</code>, <code>E_CALORIES_INITIAL</code>, <code>E_CALORIES_FINAL</code>, <code>P_CALORIES</code>, and <code>ID_CALORIES</code>
represent the true calories, initial estimates, final estimates, the predictions of others, and identification
numbers of the <code class="reqn">j</code>th meal.</p>
