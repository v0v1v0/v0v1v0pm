<h2>Data: Coin Flips</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Palley and Soll (2019) recruited individuals on Amazon Mechanical Turk and asked them
to estimate the proportion of heads in 100 flips of a biased two-sided coin. The probability
of heads was unknown to the participants, who were told that it could be anywhere between
1% and 99%. Before responding, each judge was shown a sample of flips that all judges saw
(shared information) and another sample of flips that was only seen by that individual or by
a subset of judges (private information). Three information structures were considered: 
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><strong>Symmetric:</strong> All judges saw their own unique sample of flips.
There are a total of 72 judgment tasks under this condition.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Nested:</strong> Some judges saw only the shared sample while others saw an 
additional common sample.
There are a total of 24 judgment tasks  under this condition.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Nested-Symmetric:</strong> Some judges saw only the shared sample while others
saw their own additional sample of flips.
There are a total of 24 judgment tasks  under this condition.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
