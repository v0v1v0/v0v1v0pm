<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Palley and Soll (2019)  recruited participants through ClearVoice Research and 
Amazon Mechanical Turk to estimate the probability that one team or the other would win 
various games in the 2014, 2015, and 2016 NCAA Division I Menâ€™s Basketball Tournaments. 
The responses for the Round of 64 games and Round of 16 games are treated separately 
because the Round of 64 games happen at the start of the tournament and often involve 
heavily mismatched teams (e.g., a 1 seed versus a 16 seed) while Round of 16 games typically 
involve more evenly matched teams, with implied betting market probabilities closer to 50%.

<dd>
<p>is a list of the judges' estimates of the probability that
the given team wins in Round of 64.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of the judges' estimated probability in  the <code class="reqn">j</code>th game.</p>
</dd>

<dl>
<dt><code>E_NCAA_R16</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of the judges' estimates of the probability that
the given team wins in Round of 16.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of the judges' estimated probability in  the <code class="reqn">j</code>th game.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>P_NCAA_R64</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of the judges' predictions of other judges' average probability that
the given team wins in Round of 64.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of the judges' predictions of the other judges' average probabilities in  the <code class="reqn">j</code>th game.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>P_NCAA_R16</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of the judges' predictions of other judges' average probability that
the given team wins in Round of 16.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of the judges' predictions of the other judges' average probabilities in  the <code class="reqn">j</code>th game.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>THETA_NCAA_R64</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a vector of the actual outcomes of the games in the Round of 64.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is the actual outcome of <code class="reqn">j</code>th game in Round of 64.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>THETA_NCAA_R16</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a vector of the actual outcomes of the games in the Round of 16.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is the actual outcome of <code class="reqn">j</code>th game in Round of 16.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><code>ID_NCAA_R64</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of the judges' identification numbers in the judgment tasks
associated with the Round of 64 games.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of identification numbers of judges' who participated in
estimating the probability of a given team winning the <code class="reqn">j</code>th game of Round of 64.
These values make it possible to track a judge across judgment tasks.</p>

<p>is a list of the judges' identification numbers in the judgment tasks
associated with the Round of 16 games.
Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th element is a vector of identification numbers of judges' who participated in
estimating the probability of a given team winning the <code class="reqn">j</code>th game of Round of 16.

<p>The elements of each list correspond to the same game. Specifically, the <code class="reqn">j</code>th elements of 
<code>THETA_NCAA_R16</code>, <code>E_NCAA_R16</code>, <code>P_NCAA_R16</code>, and <code>ID_NCAA_R16</code>
represent the true outcome, estimates, the predictions of others, and identification
numbers associated with the <code class="reqn">j</code>th game in the Round of 16.</p>
