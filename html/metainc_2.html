<h2>Sampled odds ratios from meta-analysis on the association between
parenteral anticoagulation and mortality in patients with cancer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Matrix with sampled odds ratios from meta-analysis on the association
between parenteral anticoagulation and mortality in patients with cancer
(Akl et al., 2017).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A matrix with 5000 sampled odds ratios (rows) for 18 studies
(columns) following a Bayesian meta-analysis.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data  from Akl et al. (2017) and displaying results presented as odds ratios. 
Each column corresponds to a different primary study.
</p>
