<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>Daniels</code> data comprises 15 phase II/III randomized clinical trials of the HIV Disease Section of the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group of the National Institutes of Health, which had data available as of May 1996, which had at least six months of follow-up on some patients and in which at least one patient developed AIDS or died. The data were previously used
by Daniels and Hughes (1997) to assess whether the change in CD4 cell count is a surrogate for time to either development of AIDS or death in drug trials of patients with HIV.
