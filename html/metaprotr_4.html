<h2>export_ipath3</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Exports the KEGG Orthology (KO) terms in the adapted format to be used in 
the tool <a href="https://pathways.embl.de/">iPATH3</a>. The exported data is 
obtained from a "spectral_count_object" containing the functional 
annotation of the identified proteins from one condition or sample.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">export_ipath3(
  spectral_count_object,
  type_export,
  target_variable,
  sample_condition,
  hexadecimal_color,
  taxonomic_levels = NULL,
  force = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>spectral_count_object</code></td>
<td>
<p>List defined as "spectral_count_object" 
containing protein abundance expressed as spectral counts by a 
taxonomic level. The functional annotation must be added to this
object. The format of this object is similar to that generated from 
the function "add_kegg".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type_export</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character indicating the type of export to be used. The
possible options are: i) "all" that selects all the KO terms from a given 
sample or a given condition; and, ii) "selection" that extracts the 
KO terms present in selected taxonomic entities (one or more).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>target_variable</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character indicating the column name from metadata 
containing the condition or sample to be analyzed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sample_condition</code></td>
<td>
<p>Atomic vector indicating the sample from which 
the functional information will be extracted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hexadecimal_color</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character indicating the color to be used in 
iPATH3, this value must be indicated in hexadecimal format (eg. #ff0000).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>taxonomic_levels</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional vector indicating the taxonomic levels
from which the KO terms will be extracted. This option is needed only
if the type of export is "selection".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>force</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logic value set at FALSE by default in order to ask 
permission to create a file in the workstation of the user.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A csv file containing the KO terms present in a given sample or 
condition. The content of this file can be inserted directly in the tool  
<a href="https://pathways.embl.de/">iPATH3</a>. The width of the lines in 
iPATH3 will be displayed by the  percentage of spectra in the selected 
sample or condition. In this way, KO terms belonging to a given taxonomic 
level are represented in three intervals based on their abundace: i) 
below 2 percent, i) between 2 to 10 percent, or i) above 10 percent.
