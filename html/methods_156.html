<h2>Fix Objects Saved from R Versions Previous to 1.8</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Beginning with R version 1.8.0, the class of an object contains the
identification of the package in which the class is defined.  The
function <code>fixPre1.8</code> fixes and re-assigns objects missing that information
(typically because they were loaded from a file saved with a previous
version of R.)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fixPre1.8(names, where)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr>
<td><code id="names">names</code></td>
<td>
<p> Character vector of the names of all the objects to be
fixed and re-assigned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code id="where">where</code></td>
<td>
<p>The environment from which to look for the objects, and
for class definitions.  Defaults to the top environment of the
call to <code>fixPre1.8</code>, the global environment if the function
is used interactively.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The named object will be saved where it was found.  Its class
attribute will be changed to the full form required by R 1.8;
otherwise, the contents of the object should be unchanged.
</p>
<p>Objects will be fixed and re-assigned only if all the following
conditions hold:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The named object exists.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> It is from a defined class (not a basic datatype which
has no actual class attribute).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The object appears to be from an earlier version of R.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The class is currently defined.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The object is consistent with the current class definition.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If any condition except the second fails, a warning message is
generated.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>fixPre1.8</code> currently fixes <em>only</em> the change in
class attributes.  In particular, it will not fix binary versions of
packages installed with earlier versions of R if these use
incompatible features.  Such packages must be re-installed from
source, which is the wise approach always when major version changes
occur in R.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The names of all the objects that were in fact re-assigned.
