<h2>Classes to Represent Unevaluated Language Objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>  The virtual class <code>"language"</code> and the specific
classes that extend it represent unevaluated objects, as produced for
example by the parser or by functions such as <code>quote</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">### each of these classes corresponds to an unevaluated object
### in the S language.
### The class name can appear in method signatures,
### and in a few other contexts (such as some calls to as()).

"("
"&lt;-"
"call"
"for"
"if"
"repeat"
"while"
"name"
"{"

### Each of the classes above extends the virtual class
"language"
</code></pre>


<h3>Objects from the Class</h3>

<p><code>"language"</code> is a virtual class; no objects may be created from
it.
</p>
<p>Objects from the other classes can be generated by a call to
<code>new(Class, ...)</code>, where <code>Class</code> is the quoted class name, and
the ... arguments are either empty or a <em>single</em> object that is
from this class (or an extension).
</p>


<h3>Methods</h3>


<dl>
<dt>coerce</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>signature(from = "ANY", to = "call")</code>.  A method
exists for <code>as(object, "call")</code>, calling <code>as.call()</code>. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">showClass("language")

is( quote(sin(x)) ) # "call"  "language"

(ff &lt;- new("if"))  ; is(ff) # "if" "language"
(ff &lt;- new("for")) ; is(ff) # "for" "language"
</code></pre>
