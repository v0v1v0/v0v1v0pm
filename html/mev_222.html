<h2>Venice Sea Levels</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>venice</code> data contains the 10 largest yearly sea levels (in cm)
from 1887 until 2019. Only the yearly maximum is available for 1922
and the six largest observations for 1936.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a data frame with 133 rows and 11 columns containing the year of the measurement (first column)
and ordered 10-largest yearly observations, reported in decreasing order from largest (<code>r1</code>) to smallest (<code>r10</code>).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Smith (1986) notes that the annual maxima seems to fluctuate around a constant sea level
up to 1930 or so, after which there is potential linear trend. Records of threshold exceedances above
80 cm (reported on the website) indicate that observations are temporally clustered.
</p>
<p>The observations from 1931 until 1981 can be found in
Table 1 in Smith (1986), who reported data from Pirazzoli (1982).
The values from 1983 until 2019 were extracted by Anthony Davison from the City
of Venice website (accessed in May 2020) and are licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license.
The Venice City website indicates
that later measurements were recorded by an instrument located in Punta Salute.
