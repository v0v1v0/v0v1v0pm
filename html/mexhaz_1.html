<h2>Mixed effect parametric excess hazard models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fit an (excess) hazard regression model using different shapes for the
baseline hazard (Weibull, piecewise constant, exponential of a B-spline
of degree 1 to 3, exponential of a restricted cubic spline), with the
possibility to include time-dependent effects of variable(s) and a
random effect defined at the cluster level. Follow-up time can be
entered in the right-censored or counting process input style. The
latter allows the modelling of survival data with delayed entries. The
time-dependent effect of a covariable is modelled by adding interaction
terms between the covariable and a function of time of the same class as
the one used for the baseline hazard (in particular, with the same knots
for piecewise constant hazards; and with the same degree and the same
knots for B-spline or restricted cubic spline functions). The random
effect is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and standard
deviation sigma. The optimisation process uses adaptive Gaussian
quadrature to calculate the cluster-specific marginal likelihoods. The
logarithm of the full marginal likelihood, defined as the sum of the
logarithms of the cluster-specific marginal likelihoods, is then
maximised using an optimisation routine such as <code>nlm</code> (default) or
<code>optim</code>. Functions to compute and plot the predicted (excess)
hazard and (net) survival are provided. In the case of a random
intercept model, three types of predictions can be obtained : marginal
(population-averaged), cluster-specific posterior (cluster-averaged), or
conditional (for a given quantile of the ditribution of the random effect).
