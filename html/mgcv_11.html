<h2>BLAS thread safety</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Most BLAS implementations are thread safe, but some versions of OpenBLAS, for example, are not. This routine is a diagnostic helper function, which you will never need if you don't set <code>nthreads&gt;1</code>, and even then are unlikely to need.   
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">blas.thread.test(n=1000,nt=4)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of iterations to run of parallel BLAS calling code.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nt</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of parallel threads to use</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>While single threaded OpenBLAS 0.2.20 was thread safe, versions 0.3.0-0.3.6 are not, and from version 0.3.7 thread safety of the single threaded OpenBLAS requires making it with the option <code>USE_LOCKING=1</code>. The reference BLAS is thread safe, as are MKL and ATLAS. This routine repeatedly calls the BLAS from multi-threaded code and is sufficient to detect the problem in single threaded OpenBLAS 0.3.x.
</p>
<p>A multi-threaded BLAS is often no faster than a single-threaded BLAS, while judicious use of threading in the code calling the BLAS can still deliver a modest speed improvement. For this reason it is often better to use a single threaded BLAS and the <code>nthreads</code> options to <code>bam</code> or <code>gam</code>. For <code>bam(...,discrete=TRUE)</code> using several threads can be a substantial benefit, especially with the reference BLAS.
</p>
<p>The MKL BLAS is mutlithreaded by default. Under linux setting environment variable <code>MKL_NUM_THREADS=1</code> before starting R gives single threaded operation.
