<h2>Histograms of the Weights, Beta1, and WQS using <code>ggplot</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Plots a WQS object producing three histograms of the weights, the overall chemical effect, and WQS
across bootstraps. These histograms are returned as <span class="pkg">ggplot2</span> objects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'wqs'
plot(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class "wqs", usually as a result of <code>estimate.wqs</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Further arguments passed from other methods. Currently has no effect.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Three histograms are produced using <code>geom_histogram</code> with ten bins.
</p>
<p>Once a Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression is run, the <strong>hist.weights</strong> is a panel of histograms. These are distributions of the weight estimates to determine which chemicals are important in the mixture. Each weight is between 0 and 1 and sum to 1. The individual bootstrapped weight estimates were used to construct the overall chemical index, WQS.
</p>
<p>The <strong>hist.beta1</strong> is the distribution of the overall effect of the mixture on the outcome across bootstraps in the training dataset. Due to the constraint in WQS regression, these estimates are either all positive or all negative as dictated by <em>b1.pos()</em> argument in <code>estimate.wqs</code>. The patterns detected here might be helpful in adjusting the signal function, which is controlled by <em>signal.fn()</em> argument in <code>estimate.wqs</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of histograms </p>

<dl>
<dt>hist.weights</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of <span class="pkg">ggplot2</span> histogram of weights across the bootstrap. Each component consists of a histogram with a weight estimate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>hist.beta1</dt>
<dd>
<p>A histogram of the overall chemical mixture effect. This parameter is constrained to be positive if the b1.pos argument in estimate.wqs() is TRUE.; otherwise, it is FALSE.</p>
</dd>
<dt>hist.WQS</dt>
<dd>
<p>A histogram of the overall chemical sum, WQS. Due to constraints, it is always between 0 and <em>n.quantiles-1</em>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
