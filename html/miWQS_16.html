<h2>Simulated Dataset 87</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 87th dataset from the simulation study with 10 percent of observations were below the detection limit (BDL) based of a real epidemiological dataset. Out of 1000 subjects, fourteen correlated chemicals are completely observed (in X.true). In this simulation design, each chemical was simulated from independent normal distributions.
</p>
<p>BDLs were created using the bottom 10th percentile of the true data. Three covariates are considered:  the child’s age, the child’s sex (Male/Female), and the child’s ethnicity/race (White, Non-Hispanic White, and Other). After creating a model matrix, male white newborns (age = 0) serves as the  reference. The age is simulated from a normal with mean of 3.78 and standard deviation of 1.85 truncated between 0 and 8. The categorical variables are simulated from independent binomial distributions.  The outcome will be simulated using a logistic WQS model with complete data:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">logit(\mu_{i}) = -1.25 + log(1.75)*WQS_{i} + 0.032*z_{age}+ -0.0285*z_{sex} + 0.540*z_{His} + 0.120*z_{other} </code>
</p>

<p>where </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn"> WQS_{i}= \Sigma_{j=1}^{c}(w_{j}*q_{ij}) </code>
</p>

<p>with four of the 14 weights <code class="reqn">w_j</code>'s being 0.25 and the rest 0. The <code class="reqn">q_ij</code> refers to the quantile score of the <em>jth</em> chemical in the <em>ith</em> subject.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list that contains: </p>

<li>
<p> y.scenario: A binary outcome (1 = case, 0 = control)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> X.true: 14 chemicals; complete data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> X.bdl: 14 chemicals with NA's subbed for the bottom 10th percentile of the true values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> DL: The detection limit. Here, found to be the 10th percentile of X.true
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> n0: A vector of length 14 indicating the number of non-detects.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> delta: A vector of length 14 indicating whether the chemical is observed (1) or not (0)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Z.sim: A data-frame of covariates consisting of: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Age: A continuous covariate of child's age , simulated using normal with mean of 3.78 and sd of 1.85, truncated between 0 and 8, the maximum age of the case.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Female: Binary variable child's sex, simulated using the proportion of females (0.42) by binomial distribution.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Hispanic, Non-Hispanic_Others: Two indicator variables of child's race/ethnicity, sampled from independent binomial distributions  (proportion of Hispanic: 0.33; proportion of Other: 0.23).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p> time: The time required to simulate the data.
</p>
