<h2>Class "count"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The count class inherits from the <code>missing_variable-class</code> and is intended for count data. 
Aside from these facts, the rest of the documentation here is primarily directed toward developers.
</p>


<h3>Objects from the Classes</h3>

<p>Objects can be created that are of count class via the 
<code>missing_variable</code> generic function by specifying <code>type = "count"</code> 
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>

<p>The count class inherits from the missing_variable class and its <code>raw_data</code> slot must consist of nonnegative
integers. Its default family is <code>quasipoisson</code> and its default <code>fit_model</code> method is 
a wrapper for <code>bayesglm</code>. The other possibility for the family is <code>poisson</code> but is
not recommended due to its overly-restrictive nature.
</p>


<h3>Author(s)</h3>
