<h2>Class "irrelevant" and Inherited Classes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The irrelevant class inherits from the <code>missing_variable-class</code> and is used to 
designate variables that are excluded from the models used to impute the missing values of 
“relevant” variables. For example, if a survey has an “id” variable that 
simply distinguishes observations, the user should designate it as irrelevant, although it 
will automatically be classified so if its name is either “id” or starts with punctuation 
(including underscores). The fixed class inherits from the irrelevant class and is used 
for variables that are constant (within a sample). A variable that is instantiated from the
fixed class cannot have any missing values. The group class inherits from the fixed 
class and is used like a <code>factor</code> to spit samples in multilevel modeling; see 
<code>multilevel_missing_data.frame-class</code>. None of these classes have an additional
slots. Aside from these facts, the rest of the documentation here is primarily directed toward developeRs.
</p>


<h3>Objects from the Classes</h3>

<p>The <code>missing_variable</code> generic function can be used to 
instantiate an object that inherits from the irrelevant class by specifying 
<code>type = "irrelevant"</code>, <code>type = "fixed"</code>, or <code>type = "group"</code>.
