<h2>The "censored-continuous" Class, the "truncated-continuous" Class and Inherited Classes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The censored-continuous class and the truncated-continuous class are both virtual and both inherit from the <code>continuous-class</code>
and each is the parent of four classes that differ depending on whether the lower and upper bounds are numeric vectors or functions. A
censored observation is one whose exact value is not observed. A truncated observation is one whose exact value is not observed and which
implies that values on some <em>other</em> variables are not observed for that unit of observation. An example of truncation might be that 
some taxation forms are not required when a person's income falls below a certain threshold. The methods for these classes are not
working yet. Aside from these facts, the rest of the documentation here is primarily directed toward developeRs.
</p>


<h3>Objects from the Classes</h3>

<p>Both the censored-continuous class and the truncated-continuous class are virtual, so no objects can be 
created with these classes. However, the <code>missing_variable</code> generic function can be used to create an object that inherits
from one of their subclasses by specifying <code>type = "NNcensored-continuous"</code>, <code>type = "NFcensored-continuous"</code>, 
<code>type = "FNcensored-continuous"</code>, <code>type = "FFcensored-continuous"</code>, <code>type = "NNtruncated-continuous"</code>, <code>type = "NFtruncated-continuous"</code>, 
<code>type = "FNtruncated-continuous"</code>, <code>type = "FFtruncated-continuous"</code>. When doing so, the lower and upper slots need to be
specified appropriately.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>

<p>The censored-continuous class and the truncated-continuous class are both virtual, both inherit from
the continuous class, both use the identity transformation by default, and both have two additional slots:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>upper</dt>
<dd>
<p>The upper bound for each observation</p>
</dd>
<dt>lower</dt>
<dd>
<p>The lower bound for each observation</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Both the censored-continuous class and the truncated-continuous class have four subclasses that differ depending 
on whether the upper and / or lower bounds are numeric vectors or functions that output numeric 
vectors (scalars are recycled and can be <code>Inf</code>). These subclasses are 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>NN_censored-continuous</dt>
<dd>
<p>where both the lower and upper bounds are numeric vectors</p>
</dd>
<dt>FN_censored-continuous</dt>
<dd>
<p>where the lower bound is a function and the upper bound is a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt>NF_censored-continuous</dt>
<dd>
<p>where the lower bound is a numeric vector and the upper bound is a function</p>
</dd>
<dt>FF_censored-continuous</dt>
<dd>
<p>where both the lower and upper bounds are functions</p>
</dd>
<dt>NN_truncated-continuous</dt>
<dd>
<p>where both the lower and upper bounds are numeric vectors</p>
</dd>
<dt>FN_truncated-continuous</dt>
<dd>
<p>where the lower bound is a function and the upper bound is a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt>NF_truncated-continuous</dt>
<dd>
<p>where the lower bound is a numeric vector and the upper bound is a function</p>
</dd>
<dt>FF_truncated-continuous</dt>
<dd>
<p>where both the lower and upper bounds are functions</p>
</dd>
</dl>
