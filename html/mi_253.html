<h2>Class "positive-continuous" and Inherited Classes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The positive-continuous class inherits from the <code>continuous-class</code> and is the parent of the proportion class.
In both cases, no observations can be zero, and in the case of the proportion class, no observations can be one. The 
<code>nonnegative-continuous-class</code> and the <code>SC_proportion-class</code> are appropriate for those situations.
Aside from these facts, the rest of the 
documentation here is primarily directed toward developeRs.
</p>


<h3>Objects from the Classes</h3>

<p>Objects can be created that are of positive-continuous or proportion class via the
<code>missing_variable</code> generic function by specifying <code>type = "positive-continuous"</code> or
<code>type = "proportion"</code>
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>

<p>The default transformation for the positive-continuous class is the <code>log</code> function. The proportion class inherits 
from the positive-continuous class and has the identity transformation and the <code>binomial</code> family as defaults, in
which case the <code>fit_model-methods</code> call the <code>betareg</code> function in the <span class="pkg">betareg</span> package. 
Alternatively, the transformation could be an inverse CDF like the <code>qnorm</code> function and the family could be <code>gaussian</code>,
in which case the <code>fit_model-methods</code> call the <code>bayesglm</code> function in the <span class="pkg">arm</span> package.
