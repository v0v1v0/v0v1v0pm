<h2>Class "categorical" and Inherited Classes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The categorical class is a virtual class that inherits from the <code>missing_variable-class</code>
and is the parent of the unordered-categorical and ordered-categorical classes. The ordered-categorical
class is the parent of both the binary and interval classes. Aside from these facts, the rest of the 
documentation here is primarily directed toward developers.
</p>


<h3>Objects from the Classes</h3>

<p>The categorical class is virtual, so no objects 
may be created from it. However, the <code>missing_variable</code> generic function can be used to 
instantiate an object that inherits from the categorical class by specifying 
<code>type = "unordered-categorical"</code>, <code>type = "ordered-categorical"</code>, 
<code>type = "binary"</code>, <code>type = "grouped-binary"</code>, or <code>type = "interval"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>

<p>The unordered-categorical class inherits from the categorical class and has no additional slots
but must have more than two uniquely observed values in its <code>raw_data</code> slot. The default <code>fit_model</code>
method is a wrapper for the <code>multinom</code> function in the <span class="pkg">nnet</span> package. The ordered-categorical 
class inherits from the categorical class and has one additional slot:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>cutpoints</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>"numeric"</code> which is a vector of thresholds (sometimes estimated) that 
govern how an assumed latent variable is divided into observed ordered categories</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <code>fit_model</code> method for an ordered-categorical variable is, by default, a wrapper for 
<code>bayespolr</code>. The binary class inherits from the ordered-categorical class and has no additional slots. 
It must have exactly two uniquely observed values in its <code>raw_data</code> slot and its <code>fit_model</code> method is,
by default, a wrapper for <code>bayespolr</code>. The grouped-binary class inherits from the binary class and
has one additional slot:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>strata</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>"character"</code> which is a vector (possibly of length one) of variable names that
group the observations into strata. The named external variables should also be categorical.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The default <code>fit_model</code> method for a grouped-binary variable is a wrapper for the <code>clogit</code>
function in the <span class="pkg">survival</span> package and the variables named in the <b>strata</b> slot are passed to the
<code>strata</code> function.
</p>
<p>The interval class inherits from the ordered-categorical class, has no additional slots, and is intended for variables 
whose observed values are only known up to orderable intervals. Its <code>fit_model</code> method is, by default, a 
wrapper for <code>survreg</code> even though it may or may not be a “survival” model in any meaningful sense.
