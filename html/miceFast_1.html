miceFast package for fast multiple imputations.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fast imputations under the object-oriented programming paradigm.
There was used quantitative models with a closed-form solution. Thus package is based on linear algebra operations.
The biggest improvement in time performance could be achieve for a calculation where a grouping variable have to be used.
A single evaluation of a quantitative model for the multiple imputations is another major enhancement.
Moreover there are offered a few functions built to work with popular R packages such as 'data.table'.
