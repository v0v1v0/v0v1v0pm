<h2>upset plot for NA values</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>wrapper around UpSetR::upset for vizualization of NA values
</p>
<p>Visualization of set intersections using novel UpSet matrix design.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">upset_NA(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>all arguments accepted by UpSetR::upset where the first one is expected to be a data.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Visualization of set data in the layout described by Lex and Gehlenborg in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3033">https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3033</a>.
UpSet also allows for visualization of queries on intersections and elements, along with custom queries queries implemented using
Hadley Wickham's apply function. To further analyze the data contained in the intersections, the user may select additional attribute plots
to be displayed alongside the UpSet plot. The user also has the the ability to pass their own plots into the function to further analyze
data belonging to queries of interest. Most aspects of the UpSet plot are customizable, allowing the user to select the plot that best suits their style.
Depending on how the features are selected, UpSet can display between 25-65 sets and between 40-100 intersections.
