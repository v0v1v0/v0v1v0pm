<h2>Name imputation blocks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This helper function names any unnamed elements in the <code>blocks</code>
specification. This is a convenience function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">name.blocks(blocks, prefix = "B")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blocks</code></td>
<td>
<p>List of vectors with variable names per block. List elements
may be named to identify blocks. Variables within a block are
imputed by a multivariate imputation method
(see <code>method</code> argument). By default each variable is placed
into its own block, which is effectively
fully conditional specification (FCS) by univariate models
(variable-by-variable imputation). Only variables whose names appear in
<code>blocks</code> are imputed. The relevant columns in the <code>where</code>
matrix are set to <code>FALSE</code> of variables that are not block members.
A variable may appear in multiple blocks. In that case, it is
effectively re-imputed each time that it is visited.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prefix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of length 1 with the prefix to
be using for naming any unnamed blocks with two or more variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function will name any unnamed list elements specified in
the optional argument <code>blocks</code>. Unnamed blocks
consisting of just one variable will be named after this variable.
Unnamed blocks containing more than one variables will be named
by the <code>prefix</code> argument, padded by an integer sequence
stating at 1.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named list of character vectors with variables names.
