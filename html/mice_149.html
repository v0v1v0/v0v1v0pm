<h2>Number of imputations per block</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the number of cells within a block for which imputation
is requested.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">nimp(where, blocks = make.blocks(where))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>where</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame or matrix with logicals of the same dimensions
as <code>data</code> indicating where in the data the imputations should be
created. The default, <code>where = is.na(data)</code>, specifies that the
missing data should be imputed. The <code>where</code> argument may be used to
overimpute observed data, or to skip imputations for selected missing values.
Note: Imputation methods that generate imptutations outside of
<code>mice</code>, like <code>mice.impute.panImpute()</code> may depend on a complete
predictor space. In that case, a custom <code>where</code> matrix can not be
specified.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blocks</code></td>
<td>
<p>List of vectors with variable names per block. List elements
may be named to identify blocks. Variables within a block are
imputed by a multivariate imputation method
(see <code>method</code> argument). By default each variable is placed
into its own block, which is effectively
fully conditional specification (FCS) by univariate models
(variable-by-variable imputation). Only variables whose names appear in
<code>blocks</code> are imputed. The relevant columns in the <code>where</code>
matrix are set to <code>FALSE</code> of variables that are not block members.
A variable may appear in multiple blocks. In that case, it is
effectively re-imputed each time that it is visited.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>
