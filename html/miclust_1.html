<h2>miclust-package: integrating multiple imputation with cluster analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cluster analysis with selection of the final number of clusters
and an optional variable selection procedure. The package is designed to
integrate the results of multiply imputed data sets while accounting for the
uncertainty that the imputations introduce in the final results. See ‘Procedure’
below for further details on how the tool works.
</p>


<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>The tool consists of a two-step procedure. In the first step,
the user provides the data to be analyzed. They can be a single data.frame or a
list of data.frames including the raw data and the imputed data sets. In the
latter case, <code>getdata</code> needs to by used first to get data prepared. In the
second step, the <code>miclust</code> performs k-means clustering with selection of
the final number of clusters and an optional (backward or forward) variable
selection procedure. Specific <code>summary</code> and <code>plot</code> methods are provided
to summarize and visualize the impact of the imputations on the results.
