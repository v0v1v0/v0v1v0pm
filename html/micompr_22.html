<h2>Data from two implementations of the PPHPC model, one of which has agent list
shuffling deactivated</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing simulation output data from two implementations of the
PPHPC model, one of which has agent list shuffling deactivated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pphpc_noshuff
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>grpoutputs</code> object containing simulation output data
from 20 runs of the PPHPC model, 10 runs from each implementation. The model
has six outputs, but the object contains a seventh output corresponding to
the concatenation of the six outputs
</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Runs are obtained from the NetLogo and Java (EX with 8 threads)
implementations of the PPHPC model available at
<a href="https://github.com/nunofachada/pphpc">https://github.com/nunofachada/pphpc</a>.  The <code>config400v1.txt</code>
configuration was used in both cases. Runs with the Java implementation
were performed with the '-u' option, i.e. with agent list shuffling turned
off.
