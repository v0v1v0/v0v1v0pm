<h2>The physeq data was modified from the (Data) Global patterns of 16S rRNA diversity at a depth of millions of sequences per sample (2011)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Published in PNAS in early 2011. This work compared the microbial
communities from 25 environmental samples and three known “mock communities”
– a total of 9 sample types – at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per sample.
Authors were able to reproduce diversity patterns seen in many other
published studies, while also invesitigating technical issues/bias by
applying the same techniques to simulated microbial communities of known
</p>
