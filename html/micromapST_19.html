<h2>micromapST Generated Warning and Error Messages - BuildBorderGroup</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The BuildBorderGroup function verifies the call parameters and the 
incoming data.  It then produces the data structures required
by micromapST to draw maps for custom geographic areas.  
The user must provide a shape file and a name table for the function
to product the user's custom border group dataset. 
This chapter documents the error and warning messages
created by the BuildBorderGroup function when a problem or error 
is discovered before R has a chance to abort the execution of the 
function.
</p>
<p>Like micromapST messages, BuildBorderGroup messages all start with 
"***" to help quickly find them in the warnings() logs and general output.
</p>
<p>The general format of the messages is:
</p>
<pre>

    ***XXXX text of message
  </pre>
<p>where the XXXX is the unque four alphanumeric message identifier of 
the message. This chapter attempts to provide insight into the cause
of the message and possible ways to resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>Messages with numbers ranging from 3000 to 3999.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><b>Conventions:</b>
The user provides the shape file and the name table to the function.
The messages attempt to provide specific information on the 
problem detected.  So, parts of the message will be modified 
to provide more specific information.  In the messages below &lt;name&gt; type
fields are used to identify the variable information in the messages.
</p>
<p>Any values in the message that are replaced by more specific information
are shown as &lt;namefield&gt;.  The explanation for the message and suggested
means of resolution will reference the &lt;namefield&gt; variable to help
define what the message is associated with in the operation of the 
BuildBorderGroup funcition.
</p>
<p>The following is a listing of all micromapST generated messages and a 
description of possible causes and solutions.
