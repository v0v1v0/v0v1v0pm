<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The rates on this file are directly age adjusted to the US 1970 
standard population and are expressed as the number of 
deaths per 100,000 person-years.  The row names are the 
2 character postal codes for the states. Note that the data 
currently available on the NCI web site are from a
later data submission and so may differ slightly 
(in first decimal place) from the rates provided here 
due to corrections to the dataset after its first publication.
The name of each row is the state abbreviation - 2 characters.
This dataset is used by the <var>micromapSEER</var> examples using the border group of "USStatesDF".
