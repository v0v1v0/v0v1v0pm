<h2>Defining different spatial areas for Linked Micromap using
the micromapST package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <var>micromapST</var> function can be used to create linked
micromaps for may different spatial areas by using different
border groups. Several border group (bordGrp) examples are
contained in the package and include the 51 states and DC of the
United States, the counties of Kansas, Maryland, New York, Utah,
the countries and provinces of the U.K. and China, and the U. S.
Seer Registries used by the National Cancer Institute.  Each
border group is a different dataset containing the unique
boundaries and operational information to allow micromapST to
work in a different spatial area. The structure of each border
group dataset is identical with the same variable names and
types of structures. A user can build their own border group
dataset to meet their specific spatial area needs.  Because the
package contains several border group datasets, the use of
lazydata or lazyloading has been disabled.
</p>
<p>The name of the border group is specified in the
<span class="option">bordGrp</span> call parameter. To permit a user to reference a
border group dataset not contained in the package, and reside in
a user's folder, the <span class="option">bordDir</span> must be used to direct the
package to the border group.  The border group must be saved
under R using the <var>save</var> function with the file extension of
".rda". For example: bordGrp="private",
bordDir="c:/SavedBorderGroups"
</p>
<p>Each border group contain six (6) datasets by the same
data.frame names. This allows the micromapST package the 
ability to quickly load a particular border group and 
create the requested micromaps. The five data.frames are: 
areaParms, areaNamesAbbrsIDs, areaVisBorders, L2VisBorders, 
RegVisBorders, and L3VisBorders. Since the same data.frame 
names are reused in each border group, the R lazyload 
feature is disabled in the package.
</p>
<p>The following describes the purpose and structure of each
data.frame in the border group dataset:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><span class="option">areaParms</span></dt>
<dd>
<p> - contains specific parameters and
operational information for the border group
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="option">areaNamesAbbrsIDs</span></dt>
<dd>
<p> - containing the names 
(full text), name abbreviations, wildcard string for name 
matching, alternate name abbrevations, regional (Level 2) 
association of the sub-area, and a numerical identifier 
for the areas in the border group.  If the border group 
is for a state, the areas would be the counties within 
the state.  If the border group is for a continent, then 
the areas are the countries on the continent. When the 
border group is for a country like the United States, 
then the areas are the administrative areas (like states, 
provinces, special administrative areas, or cities) 
within that country.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="option">areaVisBorders</span></dt>
<dd>
<p> - the boundary point lists 
for each area in the border group.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="option">L2VisBorders</span></dt>
<dd>
<p> - when a border group needs 
to have an intermediate set of boundaries drawn for 
clearity, the border group can provide the package a 
layer 2 set of boundaries via the <var>L2VisBorders</var> 
data.frame. The structure consists of the boundary 
information (point lists) of these areas and associated 
keys. Each area is linked to it's L2 boundary via the 
<var>L2_ID</var> variable (column) in the name table 
(<var>areaNamesAbbrsIDs</var> data.frame. At this time only 
the U. S. States and U. S. Seer Registry border group 
uses the L2 boundary overlays.  It uses L2VisBorders to 
draw the boundaries of U. S. States around Seer Registries 
within a state. The <var>areaParms$Map.L2Borders</var> variable 
in the border group must be set to <var>TRUE</var> for the 
package to draw the layer 2 boundaries. If a border group 
does not use an intermediate level outline, L2VisBorders 
should be set to L3VisBorders or NA and the 
<var>areaParms$Map.L2Borders</var> variable set to FALSE. 
In this case, no L2 boundaries are drawn.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="option">RegVisBorders</span></dt>
<dd>
<p> - when the border group 
wants to work with the areas on a regional basis, the 
<var>regID</var> variable in the name table (<span class="option">areaNamesAbbrsIDs</span>), 
the <span class="option">RegVisBorders</span> boundary information data.frame, 
and the <var>areaParms$aP_Regions</var> are used to enable the 
feature and provide the information to map only regions 
of areas and overlay areas with regional boundaries 
highlights. When the <span class="option">regions</span> call parameter is 
set to <var>TRUE</var> and the selected border group has the 
<var>areaParms$aP_Regions</var> set to <var>TRUE</var>, the package 
will scan the data provided by the caller and determine 
which regions are being referenced and which are not.  
The package uses the <var>regID</var> variable in the name
table(<span class="option">areaNamesAbbrsIDs</span>) to associate a area with
a region and as a key into the <var>RegVisBorders</var>
data.frame to draw the region boundaries. Any region not
containing data and any L2 area and areas within those
regions will not be drawn. If a border group does not use
the regions feature the <span class="option">RegVisBorders</span> data.frame in
the border group should be set to the L3VisBorders
data.frame or NA and the <var>areaParms$aP_Regions</var>
variablel set to <var>FALSE</var>. This will disable the regions
feature for the border group.
</p>
</dd> 
<dt><span class="option">L3VisBorders</span></dt>
<dd>
<p> - the boundary point list for an outline
of the entire geographica area referenced by the border
group.   For the U.S. or a country border group, this is the
outline of the country. For a state border group like
Kansas, this is an outline of the state. For smaller areas
like Seoul, it is an outline of the city. The L3VisBorders
data frame must be present in the border group. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The default border group is <var>USStatesBG</var> to be compatible
with older R scripts using previous versions of the
<var>micromapST</var> package.
</p>
<p>This section provide the data frame structural details of each
of the 6 data.frames and thier variables that make up a border group dataset. 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>areaParms data.frame</dt>
<dd>
<p> The <span class="option">areaParms</span> data.frame
contains specific information about and in support of its
border group. It provides column headers for the map and id
glyphics and controls several features that related to handling a 
border group by the <var>micromapST</var> package. These controls are 
specific to a border group and do not changed from one <var>micromapST</var> 
call to the next and don't have to be part of the calling parameters.
</p>
<p>For example, there are several built in titles and labels for the map 
and id glyphics. These will change for different border groups. For 
the <var>USStatesBG</var> border group, the map title is always 
"U.S. States", while in the <var>USSeerBG</var> border group the map glyphic 
title is "U.S. Seer Areas".
</p>
<p>This data.frame contains the following variables that are used by 
micromapST when handling a border group.
</p>
<p>The areaParms data.frame variables are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>areaUSData</dt>
<dd>
<p> - logical variable.  If <var>TRUE</var> then the border 
group represents the entire US area and labels will be placed on 
the first map for Alaska, Hawaii, and DC. This is option is only 
used with the <var>USStatesDF</var> and <var>USSeerBG</var> border groups.  
For the state/county border groups and foreign country border 
groups, <var>areaUSData</var> must be set to <var>FALSE</var>.  This 
variable is being retired.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>enableAlias</dt>
<dd>
<p> - logical variable. If <var>TRUE</var>, enables the use of the "alias" 
name matching feature and the <span class="option">rowNames</span>=<var>alias</var> call 
parameter. The "alias" name matching feature permits a partial 
("contains") match of the loc id data in the <span class="option">rowNamesCol</span> 
link column in the <var>statsDFrame</var> or the row.names of the
<var>statsDFrame</var> data.frame. At the present time, the "alias" 
feature is only used in the <var>USSeerBG</var> bordGrp.  It was 
implemented to be able to use directly use data generated by the
SEER*Stat website and match the loc ids to the internal SEER*Stat 
registry names in the border group. This feature can be expanded 
when needed to other border groups if the "Alias" column in the name
table is filled in with unique strings.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>aP_Regions</dt>
<dd>
<p> - logical variable. If <var>TRUE</var>, the package contains a valid 
<var>RegVisBorders</var> data.frame and the name table 
(<var>areaNamesAbbrsIDs</var>) contains the <var>regID</var> (or name) of a 
region boundary associated with the area. If the caller set the 
<span class="option">regions</span> call parameter to <var>TRUE</var>, the package will 
only draw areas in regions and the region boundaries if the region
contains areas with data. For examples: this allows you to
provide data for the west coast U. S. states and not have the 
midwest, south, or northeastern states drawn.  This feature is 
available to all border groups, but is currently only used by the 
USStatesBG, USSeerBG, UKIrelandBG and ChinaBG border groups. If set 
to <var>FALSE</var>, the regions feature is disabled and all regional 
information ignored.<br>
The <var>RegVisBorders</var> should still exist, but should be set to 
equal the <var>L3VisBorders</var> data.frame. The <span class="option">regions</span> 
call parameter will be ignored. As an example: In the USStatesBG 
and USSeerBG border groups, the regions are set up using the 
4 U. S. census regions of: West, South, Midwest, and NorthEast. 
If only data for states in the NorthEast are passed to micromapST,
only the NorthEast region and its states will be mapped when 
<span class="option">regions</span> is set to <var>TRUE</var>.  If <span class="option">regions</span> is set 
to <var>FALSE</var> then all of the boundaries for all of the U. S. 
States and DC are drawn eventhough data was only provided for the 
states in the northeast region. This feature also allows a border
group with a large number of sub-area, like the UK and Ireland 
border group to be assembled and used on a regional basis with 
fewer sub-area were the full border group is not really usable 
with linked micromap presentations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>ID.Hdr.1</dt>
<dd>
<p> - character variable. 1st title for the id type 
glyphics column. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>ID.Hdr.2</dt>
<dd>
<p> - character variable. 2nd title for the id type 
glyphics column. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map.Hdr.1</dt>
<dd>
<p> - character variable. 1st title element for the 
map type glyphics column. This variable is not implemented in this 
release.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map.Hdr.2</dt>
<dd>
<p> - character variable. 2nd title element for the map 
type glyphics column. This variable provides the type of areas in 
the map. This string should be kept to less than 12-16 characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map.Aspect</dt>
<dd>
<p> - a numeric variable. The X/Y aspect ratio for the 
map borders in this border group.  This is used to adjust the map 
glyphic to keep the area's aspect looking correct. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map.MinH</dt>
<dd>
<p>- a numeric variable. The minimum height of a 
group/row in inches 
</p>
</dd> 
<dt>Map.MaxH</dt>
<dd>
<p>- the maximum height of a group/row in inches.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>LabelCex</dt>
<dd>
<p> - a number representing the cex multiplier used 
on the <var>text</var> function when the map labels are drawn.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>bordGrp</dt>
<dd>
<p> - a character vector of the name of the border group. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map.L2VisBorders</dt>
<dd>
<p> - logical variable. If <var>TRUE</var>, the 
L2VisBorder border overlay is drawn on the map glyphics.  If 
<var>FALSE</var>, the <var>L2VisBorders</var> boundaries are not drawn. 
This option is currently only used by USSeerBG to draw state
boundaries for states containing multiple Seer Registries. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>aP_Regions</dt>
<dd>
<p> - logical variable.  If <var>TRUE</var>, the regions 
feature is enabled. When the feature is enabled, the 
<var>RegVisBorders</var> data.frame should be included in the border 
group, but it is not required.  The key to the regional feature 
is the <var>regID</var> column in the name table 
(<var>areaNamesAbbrsIDs</var>) that identifies the region associated 
with the area and the regional boundaries in the <var>RegVisBorders</var>
data.frame. If <var>FALSE</var>, the regions feature is disabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>aP_Proj</dt>
<dd>
<p> - a character vector containing the projection used 
to create the areaVisBorders, L2VisBorders, RegVisBorders, and 
L3VisBorders boundary point lists.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>aP_Units</dt>
<dd>
<p>- a character vector containing the measurement units
of the coordinates in the VisBorders boundary point lists.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map.L3VisBorders</dt>
<dd>
<p> - logical variable. If <var>TRUE</var>, the 
L2VisBorder boundary data is available to drawn on the map glyphics.
If <var>FALSE</var>, the <var>L2VisBorders</var> boundaries are not available 
and are not drawn. This option is currently only used by the
following border groups: USSeerBG.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Map.RegVisBorders</dt>
<dd>
<p> - logical variable. If <var>TRUE</var>, the 
<var>RegVisBorder</var> boundary data is available in the border group
and can be used to drawn a regional boundaryy overlay on the map 
glyphics.  If <var>FALSE</var>, the <var>RegVisBorders</var> boundary data 
is not available and regional boundaries are not drawn.  This set 
of boundaries are only only available in the following border 
groups: USStatesBG, USSeerBG, ChinaBG, and UKIrelandBG.  The 
drawing of the regional boundaries is controlled by the 
<span class="option">regionB</span> call parameter.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>areaNamesAbbrsIDs data.frame</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <var>areaNamesAbbrsIDs</var>
data.frame provides the linkages between the fullname, abbreviation, 
and numerical identifier to link the <var>statsDFrame</var> data to the 
boundaries for the county areas. It is also used to validate the 
incoming data to ensure the linkage can be established.  Within the 
boundary files, the area abbreviation is the key linkage. 
</p>
<p>The areaNamesAbbrsIDs dataset provides a table to permit the
translation of a numerical ID (e.g., FIPS codes), area
abbreviatation (should be less than 4-6 characters),
optional alternate abbreviation, and full area names in the
<var>micromapST</var> function.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>- character string of each area name.
Used to link the areas to boundaries when
<span class="option">rowNames</span> = "full" is specified. Used as the
represented name of the sub-area in "ID" glyphics
columns when <span class="option">plotNames</span> = "full" is spedified
(default).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Abbr</dt>
<dd>
<p>- the name abbreviation for each area.
Should be 2 to 3 character, but no more than 6
characters. Used to link the sub-areas to boundaries
when <span class="option">rowNames</span> = "ab" is specified. Used as the
represented name of the area in "ID" glyphics columns
when <span class="option">plotNames</span> = "ab" is specified (default).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Alt_Abr</dt>
<dd>
<p>- an alternate name abbreviation for each
sub-area. Should be 2 to 3 characters, but no more than
6 characters.  Most of the time this field is identical
to the <var>Abbr</var> field. In some cases, multiple sets of
authenticated abbreviations were found for the sub-areas
in a continent or country.  When this happened, the most
common abbreviation should be placed in the <var>Abbr</var>
field and the second abbreviation placed in the
<var>Alt_Abr</var> field.  This features allows the border
group to be used by a wider audience. To access the
<var>Alt_Abr</var> abbreviates, set the <span class="option">rowNames</span>
call argument/parameter to "alt_ab".  The labels in the
<var>statsDFrame</var> statistics data.frame will be matched
against the alternate abbreviations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>- numerical identifier for each area.  Used
to link the data to boundary information when
<span class="option">rowNames</span> = <var>id</var> is specified. The row.names
in the user provided data.frame or specificed
<span class="option">rowNamesCol</span> column must match the IDs in the
name table. If no match a warning is generated and the
data row ignored.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Alias</dt>
<dd>
<p>- a character string for each area used to do
a wildcard match ("contains") with the <span class="option">rowName</span>
or <span class="option">rowNamesCol</span> specified in the
<var>micromapST</var> call when the <var>USSeerBG</var> border
group is used. When a match is completed, the
abbreviation is used to link the user's data to the
boundary data.  The alias match is done when
<span class="option">rowNames</span> is set to "alias".  There should be
only one match in the data for each sub-area alias.  If
more are found, an error is raised.  This feature is
only supported in the <var>USSeerBG</var> border group.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>L2_ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>- is the level 2 identifier.  Used to link the area to 
the L2VisBorders boundary data point data.frame.  In the case of 
the USSeerBG border group, the L2 boundaries are state boundaries 
and the L2_ID value is the state 2 character abbreviation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>L2_ID_Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>- is the full name L2 area.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>regID</dt>
<dd>
<p>- is the region identifier.  Used to link the area to the
RegVisBorders boundary data point data.frame.  The USStatesBG and 
USSeerBG border groups use this field to like the sub-areas to the 
four (4) U. S. Census regions (Northeast, South, MidWest, and West)
This association is used with the <span class="option">regions</span> call parameter to
determine which regions and their areas, etc. will be drawn when the
caller provide data is mapped.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>regName</dt>
<dd>
<p>- is the full name of a region.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>
<p>- is a character string used to link the name
table to the boundary data in the VisBorders
data.frames. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Link</dt>
<dd>
<p>- when the initial border group is created,
the <var>Key</var>, <var>Name</var> or the <var>Abbr</var> variables
may not be able to provide a link to the original
boundary data. When this happens, the border group
creater must use an alternate "link" to tie the name
table to the boundary data.  The <var>link</var> field is
used to accomplish this in the package provided border
group building steps and functions.  Once the border
group is fully constructed, the <var>Link</var> field is not
use.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>MapL, MapX, and MapY</dt>
<dd>
<p>These three columns have replaced
the MapLabel column outlined below.  The MapL column
provides the label to be drawn at the coordinates provided 
for the area.  Only a few areas should require labels.  
To many labels will make the map unreadable in a linked 
micromap.  The MapX and MapY columns in the name table 
provide the x and y coordinates for the label on the map.
The coordinates are in the same units as the boundary 
coordinates used.
</p>
</dd> 
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>areaVisBorders, L2VisBorders, RegVisBorders, and 
L3VisBorders</dt>
<dd>
<p>There are four boundary dataset - The boundaries 
of the areas being micromapped (counties) are in areaVisBorders. 
The boundaries of an intermediate level (2) for general 
orientation are in L2VisBorders. The boundaries of regional 
areas for highlight overlays and regional only mapping and 
are in RegVisBorders. The boundaries of the an outline of 
the entire mapping area is in L3VisBorders. 
</p>
<p>These four data.frames contain the boundary point lists for
the areas, regions and total map space. The L2VisBorders,
RegVisBorders, and L3VisBorders data.frames are used to
outline groups of areas, regions of the area and the
entire space. The areaVisBorders data.frame contains the
point lists for each sub-areas and are keyed to the name
table (<var>areaNamesAbbrsIDs</var>).
</p>
<p>The data structure for each of the following four boundary
data.frames is:
</p>
<p>seq Key  x      y      hole
</p>

<dl>
<dt>seq</dt>
<dd>
<p>- a numerical sequence number of the boundary
points in the data.frame.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Key</dt>
<dd>
<p>- the Key field had different uses in each of
the four VisBorders structured data.frames. In the
areaVisBorders data.frame, the <var>Key</var> is the unique
key for the sub-area as defined in the name table
(<var>areaNamesAbbrsIDs</var>).
All of the points with the same <var>Key</var> form one or
more polygons and represent boundaries of a sub-area.
This allows the package to locate the boundary data for
a specific sub-area when needed.
</p>
<p>In the RegVisBorders boundary data.frame, the <var>Key</var>
is the region ID associated with the boundary points
(polygons). One or more sub-areas can be linked to an
region boundary via the <var>regID</var> variable in the
name table.  The USStatesBG, USSeerBG, UKIrelandBG,and
ChinaBG border groups may use of the regions feature.
</p>
<p>In the L3VisBorders, all of the <var>Key</var> field values
area set to a name that represents the entire border
group area.  The <var>Key</var> field is not used in
drawning the area's outline. The level 3 boundary
outline data.frame is always drawn when the entire
geographic area is mapped. If not all of the regions
are being mapped, then the L3 boundary is not drawn. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>x</dt>
<dd>
<p>- a numerical value for the <var>x</var> coordinates
of a polygon. The end of the polygon is signaled by an
<var>x</var> value of <var>NA</var>. The first point in the
polygon does not have to be repeated. The polygon draw
function used by micromapST will close the figure. An
area may be composed of several polygons. Holes in areas
are also represented by polygons and are associated with
the sub-area.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>y</dt>
<dd>
<p>- a numerical value for the <var>y</var> coordinates
of a polygon. The end of the polygon is signaled by an
<var>y</var> value of <var>NA</var>. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt>hole</dt>
<dd>
<p>- a logical value. If <var>TRUE</var>, the
associated polygon is a hole within the sub-area
identified by the <var>Key</var> field. A hole polygon is
always drawn using the maps background color. For this
reason, sub-areas containing holes (lakes, rivers, or
other sub-areas), must proceed any sub-area in the
data.frame that it may overlay with the hole.  For
example, if one sub-area "A" is contained within sub-
area "B",  sub-area "B" must have a hole where sub-area
"A" is located and must preceed sub-area "A" in the
VisBorders data.frame.  In this way, sub-area "B" and
its hole are drawn before sub-area "A" preventing sub-
area "B" hole from overlaying sub-area "A".
</p>
</dd>  
</dl>
<p>Hole are processed by re-drawing the hole area with the
current background color. Therefore, any area with holes
must be in the data.frame prior to any areas that may
occupy the hole's space in the map.
</p>
<p>The order of the area's boundaries in these files is very
important to allow correct processing of the holes and any
areas that overlay holes. Holes are not unpainted polygons,
but polygons repainted back to the background color. The
order should be areas with holes must preceed areas that
overlay hole space. This is required to ensure an area is
not over-painted by an area's hole
</p>
<p>Each data.frame should be validated before using to make
sure they are clean and will not generate errors when used
by <var>micromapST</var>. 
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each border group contains the same six data.frames using the
same six names.  This allows the micromapST package the
ability to quickly load a particular border group and create
the requested micromaps.
</p>
<p>See the write up on each included border group for details on
the specific content of their border group dataset and the
list of sub-area names, abbreviations, and id that should be
used to link the data to the boundary information.
</p>
<p>The <span class="option">regions</span> feature and RegVisBorder overlays are
only supported in the following border groups:
</p>
<p><var>USStatesBG</var>
<var>USSeerBG</var>
<var>UKIrelendBG</var>
<var>ChinaBG</var>
</p>
