<h2>Gene cluster weighting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes weights for gene cluster according to their distribution in a pan-genome.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">geneWeights(pan.matrix, type = c("shell", "cloud"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pan.matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A pan-matrix, see <code>panMatrix</code> for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A text indicating the weighting strategy.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When computing distances between genomes or a PCA, it is possible to give weights to the
different gene clusters, emphasizing certain aspects.
</p>
<p>As proposed by Snipen &amp; Ussery (2010), we have implemented two types of weighting: The default
‘<span class="samp">⁠"shell"⁠</span>’ type means gene families occuring frequently in the genomes, denoted shell-genes, are
given large weight (close to 1) while those occurring rarely are given small weight (close to 0).
The opposite is the ‘<span class="samp">⁠"cloud"⁠</span>’ type of weighting. Genes observed in a minority of the genomes are
referred to as cloud-genes. Presumeably, the ‘<span class="samp">⁠"shell"⁠</span>’ weighting will give distances/PCA reflecting
a more long-term evolution, since emphasis is put on genes who have just barely diverged away from the
core. The ‘<span class="samp">⁠"cloud"⁠</span>’ weighting emphasizes those gene clusters seen rarely. Genomes with similar
patterns among these genes may have common recent history. A ‘<span class="samp">⁠"cloud"⁠</span>’ weighting typically gives
a more erratic or ‘noisy’ picture than the ‘<span class="samp">⁠"shell"⁠</span>’ weighting.
