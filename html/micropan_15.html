<h2>Removing overlapping hits from HMMER3 scans</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removing hits to avoid overlapping HMMs on the same protein sequence.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hmmerCleanOverlap(hmmer.tbl)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hmmer.tbl</code></td>
<td>
<p>A table (<code>tibble</code>) with <code>hmmerScan</code> results, see <code>readHmmer</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When scanning sequences against a profile HMM database using <code>hmmerScan</code>, we
often find that several patterns (HMMs) match in the same region of the query sequence, i.e. we have
overlapping hits. The function <code>hmmerCleanOverlap</code> will remove the poorest overlapping hit
in a recursive way such that all overlaps are eliminated.
</p>
<p>The input is a <code>tibble</code> of the type produced by <code>readHmmer</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>tibble</code> which is a subset of the input, where some rows may have been deleted to
avoid overlapping hits.
