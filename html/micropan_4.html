<h2>Binomial mixture model estimates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits binomial mixture models to the data given as a pan-matrix. From the fitted models
both estimates of pan-genome size and core-genome size are available.

  core.detect.prob = 1,
  verbose = TRUE
)

<p>A pan-matrix, see <code>panMatrix</code> for details.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K.range</code></td>

<p>The range of model complexities to explore. The vector of integers specify the number

</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>core.detect.prob</code></td>
<td>
<p>The detection probability of core genes. This should almost always be 1.0,

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A binomial mixture model can be used to describe the distribution of gene clusters across
genomes in a pan-genome. The idea and the details of the computations are given in Hogg et al (2007),
Snipen et al (2009) and Snipen &amp; Ussery (2012).
</p>
<p>Central to the concept is the idea that every gene has a detection probability, i.e. a probability of
being present in a genome. Genes who are always present in all genomes are called core genes, and these
should have a detection probability of 1.0. Other genes are only present in a subset of the genomes, and
these have smaller detection probabilities. Some genes are only present in one single genome, denoted
ORFan genes, and an unknown number of genes have yet to be observed. If the number of genomes investigated
is large these latter must have a very small detection probability. 
</p>
<p>A binomial mixture model with ‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’ components estimates ‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’ detection probabilities from the
data. The more components you choose, the better you can fit the (present) data, at the cost of less
precision in the estimates due to less degrees of freedom. <code>binomixEstimate</code> allows you to
fit several models, and the input ‘<span class="samp">⁠K.range⁠</span>’ specifies which values of ‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’ to try out. There no
real point using ‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’ less than 3, and the default is ‘<span class="samp">⁠K.range=3:5⁠</span>’. In general, the more genomes
you have the larger you can choose ‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’ without overfitting.  Computations will be slower for larger
values of ‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’. In order to choose the optimal value for ‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’, <code>binomixEstimate</code>
computes the BIC-criterion, see below.
</p>
<p>As the number of genomes grow, we tend to observe an increasing number of gene clusters. Once a
‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’-component binomial mixture has been fitted, we can estimate the number of gene clusters not yet
observed, and thereby the pan-genome size. Also, as the number of genomes grows we tend to observe fewer
core genes. The fitted binomial mixture model also gives an estimate of the final number of core gene
clusters, i.e. those still left after having observed ‘infinite’ many genomes.
</p>
<p>The detection probability of core genes should be 1.0, but can at times be set fractionally smaller.
This means you accept that even core genes are not always detected in every genome, e.g. they may be
there, but your gene prediction has missed them. Notice that setting the ‘<span class="samp">⁠core.detect.prob⁠</span>’ to less
than 1.0 may affect the core gene size estimate dramatically.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>binomixEstimate</code> returns a <code>list</code> with two components, the ‘<span class="samp">⁠BIC.tbl⁠</span>’
and ‘<span class="samp">⁠Mix.tbl⁠</span>’.
</p>
<p>The ‘<span class="samp">⁠BIC.tbl⁠</span>’ is a <code>tibble</code> listing, in each row, the results for each number of components
used, given by the input ‘<span class="samp">⁠K.range⁠</span>’. The column ‘<span class="samp">⁠Core.size⁠</span>’ is the estimated number of
core gene families, the column ‘<span class="samp">⁠Pan.size⁠</span>’ is the estimated pan-genome size. The column
‘<span class="samp">⁠BIC⁠</span>’ is the Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz, 1978) that should be used to choose the
optimal component number (‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’). The number of components where ‘<span class="samp">⁠BIC⁠</span>’ is minimized is the
optimum. If minimum ‘<span class="samp">⁠BIC⁠</span>’ is reached for the largest ‘<span class="samp">⁠K⁠</span>’ value you should extend the
‘<span class="samp">⁠K.range⁠</span>’ to larger values and re-fit. The function will issue
a <code>warning</code> to remind you of this.
</p>
<p>The ‘<span class="samp">⁠Mix.tbl⁠</span>’ is a <code>tibble</code> with estimates from the mixture models. The column ‘<span class="samp">⁠Component⁠</span>’
indicates the model, i.e. all rows where ‘<span class="samp">⁠Component⁠</span>’ has the same value are from the same model.
There will be 3 rows for 3-component model, 4 rows for 4-component, etc. The column ‘<span class="samp">⁠Detection.prob⁠</span>’
contain the estimated detection probabilities for each component of the mixture models. A 
‘<span class="samp">⁠Mixing.proportion⁠</span>’ is the proportion of the gene clusters having the corresponding ‘<span class="samp">⁠Detection.prob⁠</span>’,
i.e. if core genes have ‘<span class="samp">⁠Detection.prob⁠</span>’ 1.0, the corresponding ‘<span class="samp">⁠Mixing.proportion⁠</span>’ (same row)
indicates how large fraction of the gene families are core genes.
