<h2>An Bayesian platform design without subgroup efficacy exploration(midas-2s), which is the degenerate competing design in the simulation.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>MIDAS-2s is the degenerate competing designs that do not consider subgroups. Beta-binomial model is applied for efficacy in whole population of each arm.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">platform_midas2s(seed, p, p_tox, C_T = 0.85, C_E1 = 0.15, C_E2 = 0.999)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>set a random seed to maintain the repeatability of the simulation results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix indicating the efficacy. Row number represents the number of candidate drugs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p_tox</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector indicating the toxicity.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C_T</code></td>
<td>
<p>early toxicity stopping threshold, which refers to a predefined threshold used to determine when a clinical trial should be stopped early due to unacceptable levels of toxicity or adverse events in the study participants. This threshold is established to ensure the safety and well-being of the trial participants and to prevent further harm.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C_E1</code></td>
<td>
<p>early futility stopping threshold, which refers to a predefined threshold used to determine when a clinical trial should be stopped early due to lack of efficacy or futility. It is established to prevent the continuation of a trial that is unlikely to demonstrate a significant treatment effect, thus saving time, resources, and participant exposure to ineffective treatments.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C_E2</code></td>
<td>
<p>early efficacy stopping threshold, which refers to a predefined threshold used to determine when a clinical trial should be stopped early due to the demonstration of significant efficacy or positive treatment effects. This threshold is established to allow for timely decision-making and saves sample size.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>term.tox the indicator of whether early stopping for toxicity
</p>
<p>term.fut the indicator of whether early stopping for futility
</p>
<p>term.eff the indicator of whether early stopping for efficacy
</p>
<p>final.eff a vector of final decision, either efficacy or inefficacy
</p>
<p>N sample size, which refers to the number of participants included in a study or experiment.
</p>
