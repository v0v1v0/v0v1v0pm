<h2>Determine completion status for every student</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add columns to a data frame of student-level records that indicate whether a
student completed a degree, and if so, whether their completion was timely.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_completion_status(dframe, midfield_degree = degree)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dframe</code></td>
<td>
<p>Working data frame of student-level records
to which completion-status columns are to be added. Required variables
are <code>mcid</code> and <code>timely_term.</code> See also <code>add_timely_term()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>midfield_degree</code></td>
<td>
<p>MIDFIELD <code>degree</code> data table or
equivalent with required variables <code>mcid</code> and <code>term_degree.</code></p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>By "completion" we mean an undergraduate earning their first baccalaureate
degree (or degrees, for students earning more than one degree in the same
term). Additional degrees, if any, earned later than the term of the first
degree are ignored.
</p>
<p>In many studies, students must complete a degree in a specified time span,
for example 4-, 6-, or 8-years after admission. If they do, their completion
is timely; if not, their completion is late and they are grouped with the
non-completers when computing a metric such as graduation rate.
</p>
<p>Completion status is "timely" for students completing a degree no later than
their timely completion terms. See also <code>add_timely_term()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame in <code>data.table</code> format with the following
properties: rows are preserved; columns are preserved with the exception
that columns added by the function overwrite existing columns of the
same name (if any); grouping structures are not preserved. The added
columns are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>term_degree</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Character. Term in which the first degree(s) are
completed. Encoded YYYYT. Joined from <code>midfield_degree</code> data table.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>completion_status</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Character. Label each observation to
indicate completion status. Possible values are: "timely", indicating
completion no later than the timely completion term; "late", indicating
completion after the timely completion term; and "NA" indicating
non-completion.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Start with an excerpt from the student data set 
dframe &lt;- toy_student[1:10, .(mcid)]

# Timely term column is required to add completion status column
dframe &lt;- add_timely_term(dframe, toy_term)

# Add completion status column
add_completion_status(dframe, toy_degree)

# Existing completion_status column, if any, is overwritten
dframe[, completion_status := NA_character_]
add_completion_status(dframe, toy_degree)
