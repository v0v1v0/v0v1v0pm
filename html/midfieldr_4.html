<h2>Calculate a timely completion term for every student</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Add a column to a data frame of student-level records that indicates the
latest term by which degree completion  would be considered timely for every
student.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_timely_term(
  dframe,
  midfield_term = term,
  ...,
  span = NULL,
  sched_span = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dframe</code></td>
<td>
<p>Working data frame of student-level records
to which timely-term columns are to be added. Required variable
is <code>mcid</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>midfield_term</code></td>
<td>
<p>MIDFIELD <code>term</code> data table or equivalent
with required variables <code>mcid</code>, <code>term</code>, and <code>level.</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Not used for passing values; forces subsequent arguments to be
referable only by name.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>span</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional integer scalar, number of years to define timely
completion. Commonly used values are are 100, 150, and 200 percent of
<code>sched_span.</code> Default 6 years.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sched_span</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional integer scalar, the number of years an institution
officially schedules for completing a program. Default 4 years.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>By "completion" we mean an undergraduate earning their first baccalaureate
degree (or degrees, for students earning more than one degree in the same
term).
</p>
<p>In many studies, students must complete their programs in a specified time
span, for example 4-, 6-, or 8-years after admission. If they do, their
completion is timely; if not, their completion is late and they are grouped
with the non-completers when computing a metric such as graduation rate.
</p>
<p>Our heuristic assigns <code>span</code> number of years (default is 6 years) to every
student. For students admitted at second-year level or higher, the span is
reduced by one year for each full year the student is assumed to have
completed. For example, a student admitted at the second-year level is
assumed to have completed one year of a program, so their span is reduced by
one year.
</p>
<p>The adjusted span is added to the initial term to create the timely
completion term in the <code>timely_term</code> column.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame in <code>data.table</code> format with the following
properties: rows are preserved; columns are preserved with the exception
that columns added by the function overwrite existing columns of the
same name (if any); grouping structures are not preserved. The added
columns are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>term_i</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Character. Initial term of a student's longitudinal
record, encoded YYYYT</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>level_i</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Character. Student level (01 Freshman, 02 Sophomore,
etc.) in their initial term</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>adj_span</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric. Integer span of years for timely completion
adjusted for a student's initial level.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>timely_term</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Character. Latest term by which program
completion would be considered timely for every student. Encoded YYYYT.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Start with an excerpt from the student data set 
dframe &lt;- toy_student[1:10, .(mcid)]

# Add timely completion term column
add_timely_term(dframe, midfield_term = toy_term)

# Define timely completion as 200% of scheduled span (8 years)
add_timely_term(dframe, midfield_term = toy_term, span = 8)

# Existing timely_term column, if any, is overwritten
dframe[, timely_term := NA_character_]
add_timely_term(dframe, midfield_term = toy_term)
