<h2>Calculate births for each element of place of birth - place of residence stock matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is predominantly intended to be used within the ffs routines in the migest package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">birth_mat(b_por = NULL, m2 = NULL, method = "native", non_negative = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>b_por</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of numeric values for births in each place of residence</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix of migrant stock totals at time <em>t</em>+1. Rows in the matrix correspond to place of birth and columns to place of residence at time <em>t</em>+1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string of either <code>"native"</code> or <code>"proportion"</code> to choose method to distribute births. The <code>"proportion"</code> method assumes the rate of non-migration increase in each place of birth sub-group (native born and all foreign born stocks) is the same. The <code>"native"</code> method ensures that all births (non-migration increases) in stocks belong to the native born population (they do not move straight after birth).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>non_negative</code></td>
<td>
<p>Adjust birth matrix calculation to ensure all deductions from <code>m2</code> will result in positive population counts. On rare occasions when working with international stock data the number of births can exceed the increase in the number of native born population.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Matrix of place of birth by place of residence for new-bornâ€™s
