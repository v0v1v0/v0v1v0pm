<h2>MIIC, causal network learning algorithm including latent variables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>MIIC (Multivariate Information-based Inductive Causation) combines
constraint-based and information-theoretic approaches to disentangle direct
from indirect effects amongst correlated variables, including cause-effect
relationships and the effect of unobserved latent causes.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>input_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>[a data frame, required]
</p>
<p>A n*d data frame (n samples, d variables) that contains the observational data.
</p>
<p>In standard mode, each column corresponds to one variable and each row is a
sample that gives the values for all the observed variables.
The column names correspond to the names of the observed variables.
Numeric columns with at least 5 distinct values will be treated as continuous
by default whilst numeric columns with less than 5 distinct values, factors
and characters will be considered as categorical.
</p>
<p>In temporal mode, the expected data frame layout is variables as columns
and time series/time steps as rows.
The time step information must be supplied in the first column and,
for each time series, be consecutive and in ascending order (increment of 1).
Multiple trajectories can be provided, miic will consider that a new trajectory
starts each time a smaller time step than the one of the previous row is encountered.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>state_order</code></td>
<td>
<p>[a data frame, optional, NULL by default]
</p>
<p>A data frame providing extra information for variables. It must have d rows
where d is the number of input variables and possible columns are described
below. For optional columns, if they are not provided or contain missing
values, default values suitable for <em>input_data</em> will be used.
</p>
<p><em>"var_names"</em> (required) contains the name of each variable as specified
by colnames(input_data). In temporal mode, the time steps column should
not be mentioned in the variables list.
</p>
<p><em>"var_type"</em> (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if each
variable is to be considered as discrete (0) or continuous (1).
</p>
<p><em>"levels_increasing_order"</em> (optional) contains a single character string
with all of the unique levels of the ordinal variable in increasing order,
delimited by comma ','. It will be used during the post-processing to compute
the sign of an edge using Spearman's rank correlation. If a variable is
continuous or is categorical but not ordinal, this column should be NA.
</p>
<p><em>"is_contextual"</em> (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if a
variable is to be considered as a contextual variable (1) or not (0).
Contextual variables cannot be the child node of any other variable (cannot
have edge with arrowhead pointing to them).
</p>
<p><em>"is_consequence"</em> (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if a
variable is to be considered as a consequence variable (1) or not (0).
Edges between consequence variables are ignored, consequence variables
cannot be the parent node of any other variable and cannot be used as
contributors. Edges between a non consequence and consequence variables
are pre-oriented toward the consequence.
</p>
<p>Several other columns are possible in temporal mode:
</p>
<p><em>"n_layers"</em> (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the
number of layers to be considered for the variable.
Note that if a <em>"n_layers"</em> column is present in the <em>state_order</em>,
its values will overwrite the function parameter.
</p>
<p><em>"delta_t"</em> (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the number
of time steps between each layer for the variable.
Note that if a <em>"delta_t"</em> column is present in the <em>state_order</em>,
its values will overwrite the function parameter.
</p>
<p><em>"mov_avg"</em> (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the size
of the moving average window to be applied to the variable.
Note that if <em>"mov_avg"</em> column is present in the <em>state_order</em>,
its values will overwrite the function parameter.</p>

<td><code>true_edges</code></td>
<td>
<p>[a data frame, optional, NULL by default]
</p>
<p>A data frame containing the edges of the true graph for
computing performance after the run.<br>
In standard mode, the expected layout is a two columns data frame, each row
representing a true edge with in each column, the variable names.
Variables names must exist in the <em>input_data</em> data frame.<br>
In temporal mode, the expected layout is a three columns data frame,
with the first two columns being variable names and the third the lag.
Variables names must exist in the <em>input_data</em> data frame and the lag
must be valid in the time unfolded graph. e.g. a row var1, var2, 3 is valid
with <em>n_layers</em> = 4 + <em>delta_t</em> = 1 or
<em>n_layers</em> = 2 + <em>delta_t</em> = 3
but not for <em>n_layers</em> = 2 + <em>delta_t</em> = 2 as there is no matching
edge in the time unfolded graph.<br>
Please note that the order is important: in standard mode, "var1 var2" will
be interpreted as var1 -&gt; var2 and in temporal mode, "var1 var2 3" is
interpreted as var1_lag3 -&gt; var2_lag0. Please note also that, in temporal
mode, for contextual variables that are not lagged, the expected value in the
third column for the time lag is NA.</p>

<td><code>black_box</code></td>
<td>
<p>[a data frame, optional, NULL by default]
</p>
<p>A data frame containing pairs of variables that will be considered

will not be included in the skeleton initialization and cannot be part of
the final result.<br>
In standard mode, the expected layout is a two columns data frame, each row
representing a forbidden edge with in each column, the variable names.
Variables names must exist in the <em>input_data</em> data frame.<br>
In temporal mode, the expected layout is a three columns data frame,
with the first two columns being variable names and the third the lag.
Variables names must exist in the <em>input_data</em> data frame and the lag

but not for <em>n_layers</em> = 2 + <em>delta_t</em> = 2 as there is no matching
edge in the time unfolded graph. Please note that the order is important:
var1, var2, 3 is interpreted as var1_lag3 - var2_lag0. Please note also that,
for contextual variables that are not lagged, the expected value in the
third column for the time lag is NA.</p>

<td><code>cplx</code></td>
<td>
<p>[a string, optional, "nml" by default, possible values:
"nml", "bic"]
</p>
<p>In practice, the finite size of the input  dataset requires that
the 2-point and 3-point information measures should be <em>shifted</em>
by a <em>complexity</em> term. The finite size corrections can be based on
the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
However, the BIC complexity term tends to underestimate the
relevance of edges connecting variables with many different categories,
leading to the removal of false negative edges. To avoid such biases
with finite datasets, the (universal) Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML)
criterion can be used (see Affeldt 2015).</p>

<p>When the <em>consistent</em> parameter is set to "skeleton" or "orientation"

one inconsistent graphs, a consensus graph will be produced based on
a pool of graphs.
If the result graph is inconsistent, then the pool is made of
<em>max_iteration</em> graphs from the iterations, otherwise it is made of
those graphs in the union.
In the consensus graph, an edge is present when the proportion of non-zero
status in the pool is above the threshold. For example, if the pool contains
[A, B, B, 0, 0], where "A", "B" are different status of the edge and "0"
indicates the absence of the edge. Then the edge is set to connected ("1")
if the proportion of non-zero status (0.6 in the example) is equal to
or higher than <em>consensus_threshold</em>. (When set to connected,
the orientation of the edge will be further determined by the average
probability of orientation.)</p>

<td><code>negative_info</code></td>
<td>
<p>[a boolean value, optional, FALSE by default]
</p>
<p>If TRUE, negative shifted mutual information is allowed during the
computation when mutual information is inferior to the complexity term.
For small dataset with complicated structures, e.g. discrete variables with
many levels, allowing for negative shifted mutual information may help
identifying weak v-structures related to those discrete variables,
as the negative three-point information in those cases will come from
the difference between two negative shifted mutual information terms
(expected to be negative due to the small sample size).
However, under this setting, a v-structure (X -&gt; Z &lt;- Y) in the final graph
does not necessarily imply that X is dependent on Y conditioning on Z,
As a consequence, the reliability of certain orientations is not guaranteed.
By contrast, keeping this parameter as FALSE is more conservative and leads
to more reliable orientations (see Cabeli 2021 and Ribeiro-Dantas 2024).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes
dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from
indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of
available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature
of causality in observational data. Miic distinguishes genuine causal edges
(with both reliable arrow heads and tails) from putative causal edges (with
one reliable arrow head only) and latent causal edges (with both reliable
arrow heads). (see Ribeiro-Dantas 2024)
</p>
<p>In temporal mode, miic reorganizes the dataset using the <em>n_layers</em> and
<em>delta_t</em> parameters to transform the time steps into lagged samples.
As starting point, a lagged graph is created with only edges having at
least one node laying on the last time step.
Then, miic standard algorithm is applied to remove dispensable edges.
The remaining edges are then duplicated to ensure time invariance
(stationary dynamic) and oriented using the temporality and the
signature of causality in observational data. The use of temporal mode
is presented in Simon 2024.
</p>
<p>The method relies on information theoretic principles which replace
(conditional) independence tests as described in Affeldt 2015, Cabeli 2020,
Cabeli 2021 and Ribeiro-Dantas 2024. It deals with both categorical and
continuous variables by performing optimal context-dependent discretization.
As such, the input data frame may contain both numerical columns which will
be treated as continuous, or character / factor columns which will be treated
as categorical. For further details on the optimal discretization method and
the conditional independence test, see the function discretizeMutual.
The user may also choose to run miic with scheme presented in Li 2019
and Ribeiro-Dantas 2024 to improve the end result's interpretability
by ensuring consistent separating sets.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <em>miic-like</em> object that contains:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>summary:</em> a data frame with information about the
relationship between relevant pair of variables.
</p>
<p>As returning the information on all possible pairs of variables could lead
to an huge data frame, by convention, the summary does not include pair of
variables not sharing information at all (<em>I'(x,y) &lt;= 0</em>).
However, as exception to this convention, when a ground truth is supplied
(using the <em>true_edges</em> parameter), the edges that are not retained
by MIIC because the variables does not share information at all
but are present in the true edges will be included in the summary
to report correctly all the false negative edges.
</p>
<p>So, the summary contains these categories of edges:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> edges retained
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> edges not retained after conditioning on some contributor(s)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> edges not retained without conditioning but present in true edges
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>while these edges are not considered as relevant and are not included:
</p>

<ul><li>
<p> edges not retained without conditioning and not in true edges
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Information available in the summary are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>x:</em> X node name
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>y:</em> Y node name
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>type:</em> contains 'N' if the edge has been removed or 'P' for
retained edges. If the true graph is supplied in the <em>true_edges</em>
parameter, 'P' becomes 'TP' (True Positive) or 'FP' (False Positive),
while 'N' becomes 'TN' (True Negative) or 'FN' (False Negative).
Note that, as the <em>summary</em> does not contain all the
removed edges, edges not present have to be considered as 'N'
and, if the true graph is supplied, as 'TN'.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>ai:</em> the contributing nodes found by the method which
contribute to the mutual information between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>,
and possibly separate them.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>raw_contributions:</em> describes the share of total mutual
information between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> explained by each contributor,
measured by I'(x;y;ai|{aj}) / I'(x;y),
where {aj} is the separating set before adding ai.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>contributions:</em> describes the share of remaining mutual
information between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> explained  by each successive
contributors, measured by I'(x;y;ai|{aj}) / I'(x;y|{aj}),
where {aj} is the separating set before adding ai. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>info:</em> the mutual information <em>I(x;y)</em> times <em>n_xy</em>,
the number of samples without missing or NA values for both <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em>. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>n_xy:</em> gives the number of samples on which the information
without conditioning has been computed. If the input dataset
has no missing value, the number of samples is the same for all pairs
and corresponds to the total number of samples.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>info_cond:</em> the conditional mutual information <em>I(x;y|ai)</em>
times the number of samples without NA <em>n_xy_ai</em> used in the
computation.
<em>info_cond</em> is equal to <em>info</em> when <em>ai</em> is an empty set.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>cplx:</em> the complexity term for the pair (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>)
taking into account the contributing nodes <em>ai</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>n_xy_ai:</em> the number of samples without NA in
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> and all nodes in <em>ai</em> on which the
information and the complexity terms are computed.
If the input dataset has no missing value, the number of samples is the
same for all pairs and corresponds to the total number of samples.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>info_shifted:</em> value equal to <em>info_cond</em> - <em>cplx</em>.
Used to decide whether the edge is retained (when positive),
or removed (when zero or possibly negative when the parameter
<em>negative_info</em> is set to TRUE).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>ort_inferred:</em> the orientation of the edge (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>).
0: edge removed, 1: un-directed, 2: directed from X to Y, -2: directed
from Y to X, 6: bi-directed.<br>
When the <em>consistent</em> option is turned on and there is more than
one graph in the consistent cycle, this is the inferred orientation
of the edge in the last graph in the cycle. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>ort_ground_truth:</em> the orientation of the edge (<em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>) in the ground truth graph when true edges are provided.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>is_inference_correct:</em> indicates if the inferred orientation
agrees with the provided ground truth. TRUE: agrees, FALSE: disagrees and
set to NA when no ground truth is supplied.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>is_causal:</em> boolean value indicating the causal nature of the
arrow tips of an edge, based on the probabilities given in the columns
<em>p_y2x</em> and <em>p_x2y</em>. TRUE: when the edges is directed
and both the head and the tail are set with high confidence
(adjustable with the <em>ort_consensus_ratio</em> parameter),
FALSE otherwise or NA if the edge is not retained.
More formally, an oriented edge is marked as genuine causal when
<code class="reqn"> (1 - p_{head}) / p_{head} &lt; </code> <em>ort_consensus_ratio</em>
and  <code class="reqn"> p_{tail} / (1 - p_{tail}) &lt; </code> <em>ort_consensus_ratio</em>.<br>
A directed edge not marked as genuine causal indicates that only
the head is set with high confidence, while the tail remains uncertain.
This corresponds to a putative causal edge, which could either be
a genuine causal edge or a bi-directed edge from a latent confounder.<br>
Note that the genuine causality is deducible only when latent variables
are allowed and propagation is not allowed.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>ort_consensus:</em> Not computed (NAs) when
consistency is not activated or, when consistency is on,
if there is only one graph returned (no cycle).
When computed, indicates the consensus orientation of the edge
determined from the consensus skeleton and the <em>ort_consensus_ratio</em>
threshold on averaged orientation probabilities over the cycle of graphs.
Possible values are 0: not connected, 1: un-directed, -2 or 2: directed
and 6: bi-directed (latent variable).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>is_causal_consensus:</em> Not computed (NAs) when
consistency is not activated or, when consistency is on,
if there is only one graph returned (no cycle).
When computed, work in the same way as <em>is_causal</em>
but on the consensus graph.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>edge_stats:</em> Not computed (NAs) when
consistency is not activated or, when consistency is on,
if there is only one graph returned (no cycle).
When computed, contains the frequencies of all <em>ort_inferred</em>
values present in the cycle of graphs for the edge (<em>x, y</em>),
in the format [percentage(orientation)], separated by ";".
e.g. In a cycle of 4 graphs, if an edge is three times marked as 2
(directed) and one time marked as 1 (un-directed), edge_stats will
contain "75%(2);25%(1)".
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>sign:</em> the sign of the partial correlation between variables
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, conditioned on the contributing nodes <em>ai</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>partial_correlation:</em> value of the partial correlation for the
edge (<em>x, y</em>) conditioned on the contributing nodes <em>ai</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>p_y2x:</em> probability of the arrowhead from <em>y</em> to <em>x</em>,
of the inferred orientation, derived from the three-point mutual information
(see Verny 2017 and Ribeiro-Dantas 2024). NA if the edge is removed.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>p_x2y:</em> probability of the arrowhead from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em>,
of the inferred orientation, derived from the three-point mutual information
(see Verny 2017 and Ribeiro-Dantas 2024). NA if the edge is removed.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>confidence:</em> computed only when the confidence cut is
activated, NA otherwise.
When computed, it corresponds to a measure of the strength of the retained
edges: it is the ratio between the probability to reject the edge
<em>exp(-info_shifted(x;y|ai))</em> in the original dataset and
the mean probability to do the same in <em>n_shuffles</em> number
of randomized datasets. Edges with <em>confidence</em> &gt; <em>conf_threshold</em>
will be filtered out from the graph.
(see parameters <em>n_shuffles</em> and <em>conf_threshold</em>)

</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>edges:</em> a data frame with the raw edges output coming from
the C++ core function. This data frame is used internally by MIIC to
produce the summary and contains all pairs of variables (<em>x, y</em>). 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>triples:</em> this data frame lists the orientation
probabilities of the two edges of all unshielded triples of the
reconstructed network with the structure: node1 – mid-node – node2:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>node1:</em> node at the end of the unshielded triplet
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>p1:</em> probability of the arrowhead node1 &lt;- mid-node
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>p2:</em> probability of the arrowhead node1 -&gt; mid-node
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>mid-node:</em> node at the center of the unshielded triplet
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>p3:</em> probability of the arrowhead mid-node &lt;- node2
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>p4:</em> probability of the arrowhead mid-node -&gt; node2
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>node2:</em> node at the end of the unshielded triplet
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>ni3:</em> 3 point (conditional) mutual information * N
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>conflict:</em> indicates if there is a conflict between the
computed probabilities and the <em>ni3</em> value
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p><em>adj_matrix:</em> the adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to
represent the inferred graph. The entries of the matrix indicate whether
pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. The matrix can be read
as a (row, column) set of couples where the row represents the source node
and the column the target node. Since miic can reconstruct mixed networks
(including directed, un-directed and bi-directed edges), we will have a
different digit for each case:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 1: (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) edge is un-directed
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 2: (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) edge is directed as <em>x</em> -&gt; <em>y</em> 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> -2: (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) edge is directed as <em>x</em> &lt;- <em>y</em> 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 6: (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) edge is bi-directed
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p><em>proba_adj_matrix:</em> the probability adjacency matrix is
a square matrix used to represent the orientation probabilities associated
to the edges tips. The value at ("row", "column") is the probability,
for the edge between "row" and "column" nodes, of the edge tip on the "row"
side. A probability less than 0.5 is an indication of a possible tail
(cause) and a probability greater than 0.5 a possible head (effect). 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>adj_matrices:</em> present only when consistency is activated.
The list of the adjacency matrices, one for each graph
which is part of the resulting cycle of graphs.
Each item is a square matrix with the same layout as <em>adj_matrix</em>. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>proba_adj_matrices:</em> present only when consistency is activated.
The list of the probability adjacency matrices, one for each graph
which is part of the resulting cycle of graphs. Each item is a
square matrix with the same layout as <em>proba_adj_matrix</em>. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>proba_adj_average:</em> present only when consistency is activated.
The average probability adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to
represent the orientation probabilities associated to the edges tips
of the consensus graph. Its layout is the same as <em>proba_adj_matrix</em>
and it contains the averaged probability of edges tips over the resulting
cycle of graphs. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>is_consistent:</em> present only when consistency is activated.
TRUE if the returned graph is consistent, FALSE otherwise. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>time:</em> execution time of the different steps and total run-time
of the causal graph reconstruction by MIIC. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>interrupted:</em> TRUE if causal graph reconstruction has been
interrupted, FALSE otherwise. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>scores:</em> present only when true edges have been supplied.
Contains the scores of the returned graph in regard of the ground truth:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>tp</em>: number of edges marked as True Positive 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>fp</em>: number of edges marked as False Positive 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>fn</em>: number of edges marked as False Negative 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>precision</em>: Precision 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>recall</em>: Recall 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>fscore</em>: F1-Score 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p><em>params:</em> the list of parameters used for the network
reconstruction. The parameters not supplied are initialized to their default
values. Otherwise, the parameters are checked and corrected if necessary. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>state_order:</em> the state order used for the network
reconstruction. If no state order is supplied, it is generated by using
default values. Otherwise, it is the state order checked and corrected
if necessary.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>black_box:</em> present only if a black box has been supplied,
the black box, checked and corrected if necessary, used for the network
reconstruction.

</li>
<li> <p><em>true_edges:</em> present only if the true edges have been supplied,
