<h2>The milr package: multiple-instance logistic regression with lasso penalty</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The multiple instance data set consists of many independent subjects (called bags) 
and each subject is composed of several components (called instances). The outcomes 
of such data set are binary or multinomial, and, we can only observe the subject-level 
outcomes. For example, in manufactory processes, a subject is labeled as "defective" 
if at least one of its own components is defective, and otherwise, is labeled as 
"non-defective".  The milr package focuses on the predictive model for the multiple 
instance data set with binary outcomes and performs the maximum likelihood estimation 
with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm under the framework of logistic regression.  
Moreover, the LASSO penalty is attached to the likelihood function for simultaneous parameter 
estimation and variable selection.
