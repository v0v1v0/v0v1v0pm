<h2>
Sample Under Consideration of an Already Treated Subset of Units
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a previous treatment assignment vector for a subset of all observations that treatment assigment is desired for, the function computes a treatment assignment vector for which the previously assigned units are not changed.
At a later step, the previously assigned units are also taken into consideration for computation of the score value, the min MSE function, to achieve balanced treatment groups.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sample_with_prev_treatment(prev_treatment, n_treatments, n_per_group)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prev_treatment</code></td>
<td>
<p>takes a numerical vector of partial treatment assignment as argument, and – for a start – assigns the missing units (where the value is NA) to a random treatment group, while maintaining the same proportions in the groups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_treatments</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the number of treatment groups desired (in addition to the control group). They might be more than the ones already defined in prev_treatment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_per_group</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the distribution of participants per experimental group. It is either an integer, which produces even-sized groups, or a vector which has the same length as the number of experimental groups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a treatment assignment vector where the observations given by prev_treatment are unmodified, and the others are assigned to a group.
