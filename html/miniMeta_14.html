<h2>Sample size calculator for continuous outcomes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates sample size for a trial with a continuous outcome, for a given
power and false positive rate.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sampleSizeCont(Dm, SD, a = 0.05, b = 0.2, K = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Dm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Anticipated absolute difference in means between the two groups
(intervention and control).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SD</code></td>
<td>
<p>Anticipated standard deviation for the outcome.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td>
<p>False positive rate (alpha). Defaults to 0.05 (5%).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>b</code></td>
<td>
<p>False negative rate (beta). Defaults to 0.2. 
Power is one minus beta; thus the default is 80% power.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ratio of intervention group size to control group size. 
Defaults to 1, meaning both groups have the same size. 
Set to infinity (<code>Inf</code>) in order to calculate sample size for a 
<em>single-group study</em>, see details below.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An integer vector of length 2, with the sample sizes for the 
control and intervention groups. 
</p>
<p>If <code>K=Inf</code>, then the sample size calculation is not for a study
with two groups, but for a single-group study in which we try to show
a difference from a fixed known population mean. In that case, argument 
<code>Dm</code> represents the absolute difference between the study mean and
population mean, rather than the difference in means between two groups.
And the return value is a single value, i.e. the sample size of the study.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Sample size for a trial with 2:1 randomization, aiming to show a mean
# difference of 2 for a continuous outcome with a standard deviation of 3, 
# with 90\% power.
sampleSizeCont(2, 3, b=0.1, K=2)

# Similar for a single-group study aiming to show a difference of 2 against
# a known population mean. 
sampleSizeCont(2, 3, b=0.1, K=Inf)
