<h2>Daemons (Set Persistent Processes)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Set ‘daemons’ or persistent background processes to receive
<code>mirai</code> requests. Specify ‘n’ to create daemons on the
local machine. Specify ‘url’ for receiving connections from remote
daemons (for distributed computing across the network). Specify
‘remote’ to optionally launch remote daemons via a remote
configuration. By default, dispatcher ensures optimal scheduling.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">daemons(
  n,
  url = NULL,
  remote = NULL,
  dispatcher = c("process", "thread", "none"),
  ...,
  force = TRUE,
  seed = NULL,
  tls = NULL,
  pass = NULL,
  .compute = "default"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer number of daemons to set.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>url</code></td>
<td>
<p>[default NULL] if specified, the character URL or vector of URLs
on the host for remote daemons to dial into, including a port accepting
incoming connections (and optionally for websockets, a path), e.g.
'tcp://hostname:5555' or 'ws://10.75.32.70:5555/path'. Specify a URL
starting 'tls+tcp://' or 'wss://' to use secure TLS connections.
Auxiliary function <code>host_url</code> may be used to construct a
valid host URL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>remote</code></td>
<td>
<p>[default NULL] required only for launching remote daemons, a
configuration generated by <code>remote_config</code> or
<code>ssh_config</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dispatcher</code></td>
<td>
<p>[default 'process'] character value, one of
‘process’, ‘thread’ or ‘none’. Whether to deploy
dispatcher in another process, on a thread or not at all. Dispatcher is
an extension that ensures optimal scheduling, although this is not always
required (for details see Dispatcher section below). Note that the option
‘thread’ is new and currently considered experimental.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) additional arguments passed through to
<code>dispatcher</code> if using dispatcher and/or <code>daemon</code>
if launching daemons. These include ‘retry’ and ‘token’ at
dispatcher and ‘asyncdial’, ‘autoexit’, ‘cleanup’,
‘output’, ‘maxtasks’, ‘idletime’, ‘walltime’
and ‘timerstart’ at daemon.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>force</code></td>
<td>
<p>[default TRUE] logical value whether to always reset daemons and
apply new settings for a compute profile, even if already set. If FALSE,
applying new settings requires daemons to be explicitly reset first using
<code>daemons(0)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>[default NULL] (optional) supply a random seed (single value,
interpreted as an integer). This is used to inititalise the L'Ecuyer-CMRG
RNG streams sent to each daemon. Note that reproducible results can be
expected only for <code>dispatcher = 'none'</code>, as the unpredictable timing
of task completions would otherwise influence the tasks sent to each
daemon. Even for <code>dispatcher = 'none'</code>, reproducibility is not
guaranteed if the order in which tasks are sent is not deterministic.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tls</code></td>
<td>
<p>[default NULL] (optional for secure TLS connections) if not
supplied, zero-configuration single-use keys and certificates are
automatically generated. If supplied, <strong>either</strong> the character path
to a file containing the PEM-encoded TLS certificate and associated
private key (may contain additional certificates leading to a validation
chain, with the TLS certificate first), <strong>or</strong> a length 2 character
vector comprising [i] the TLS certificate (optionally certificate chain)
and [ii] the associated private key.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pass</code></td>
<td>
<p>[default NULL] (required only if the private key supplied to
‘tls’ is encrypted with a password) For security, should be
provided through a function that returns this value, rather than directly.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>.compute</code></td>
<td>
<p>[default 'default'] character value for the compute profile
to use (each compute profile has its own independent set of daemons).</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Use <code>daemons(0)</code> to reset daemon connections:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> All connected daemons and/or dispatchers exit automatically.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">mirai</span> reverts to the default behaviour of creating a new
background process for each request.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Any unresolved ‘mirai’ will return an ‘errorValue’ 19
(Connection reset) after a reset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Calling <code>daemons</code> with revised (or even the same) settings for
the same compute profile resets daemons before applying the new settings
if <code>force = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the host session ends, all connected dispatcher and daemon processes
automatically exit as soon as their connections are dropped (unless
the daemons were started with <code>autoexit = FALSE</code>). If a daemon is
processing a task, it will exit as soon as the task is complete.
</p>
<p>To reset persistent daemons started with <code>autoexit = FALSE</code>, use
<code>daemons(NULL)</code> instead, which also sends exit instructions to all
connected daemons prior to resetting.
</p>
<p>For historical reasons, <code>daemons()</code> with no arguments returns the
value of <code>status</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If using dispatcher, the integer number of daemons set, or else the
integer number of daemons launched locally (zero if using a remote
launcher).
</p>


<h3>Local Daemons</h3>

<p>Daemons provide a potentially more efficient solution for asynchronous
operations as new processes no longer need to be created on an <em>ad
hoc</em> basis.
</p>
<p>Supply the argument ‘n’ to set the number of daemons. New
background <code>daemon</code> processes are automatically created on
the local machine connecting back to the host process, either directly or
via dispatcher.
</p>


<h3>Dispatcher</h3>

<p>By default <code>dispatcher = "process"</code> launches a background process
running <code>dispatcher</code>. Dispatcher connects to daemons on
behalf of the host and ensures optimal FIFO scheduling of tasks.
</p>
<p>Specifying <code>dispatcher = "thread"</code> runs dispatcher logic on a new
thread, a faster and more efficient alternative to using a separate
process. This is a new feature and should be considered experimental.
</p>
<p>Specifying <code>dispatcher = "none"</code>, uses the default behaviour without
additional dispatcher logic. In this case daemons connect directly to the
host and tasks are distributed in a round-robin fashion. Optimal
scheduling is not guaranteed as the duration of tasks cannot be known
<em>a priori</em>, hence tasks can be queued at one daemon while other
daemons remain idle. However, this provides the most resource-light
approach, suited to working with similar-length tasks, or where
concurrent tasks typically do not exceed available daemons.
</p>


<h3>Distributed Computing</h3>

<p>Specifying ‘url’ allows tasks to be distributed across the network.
This should be a character string such as ‘tcp://10.75.32.70:5555’
at which daemon processes should connect to. Switching the URL scheme to
‘tls+tcp://’ or ‘wss://’ automatically upgrades the
connection to use TLS. The auxiliary function <code>host_url</code> may
be used to automatically construct a valid host URL based on the
computer's hostname.
</p>
<p>Specify ‘remote’ with a call to <code>remote_config</code> or
<code>ssh_config</code> to launch daemons on remote machines. Otherwise,
<code>launch_remote</code> may be used to generate the shell commands to
deploy daemons manually on remote resources.
</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are also supported and must be enclosed in square brackets
[ ] to avoid confusion with the final colon separating the port. For
example, port 5555 on the IPv6 loopback address ::1 would be specified
as ‘tcp://[::1]:5555’.
</p>
<p>Specifying the wildcard value zero for the port number e.g.
‘tcp://[::1]:0’ or ‘ws://[::1]:0’ will automatically assign
a free ephemeral port. Use <code>status</code> to inspect the actual
assigned port at any time.
</p>
<p><strong>With Dispatcher</strong>
</p>
<p>When using dispatcher, it is recommended to use a websocket URL rather
than TCP, as this requires only one port to connect to all daemons: a
websocket URL supports a path after the port number, which can be made
unique for each daemon.
</p>
<p>Specifying a single host URL such as ‘ws://10.75.32.70:5555’ with
<code>n = 6</code> will automatically append a sequence to the path, listening
to the URLs ‘ws://10.75.32.70:5555/1’ through
‘ws://110.75.32.70:5555/6’.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, specify a vector of URLs to listen to arbitrary port
numbers / paths. In this case it is optional to supply ‘n’ as this
can be inferred by the length of vector supplied.
</p>
<p>Individual daemons then dial in to each of these host URLs. At most one
daemon can be dialled into each URL at any given time.
</p>
<p>Dispatcher automatically adjusts to the number of daemons actually
connected. Hence it is possible to dynamically scale up or down the
number of daemons as required, subject to the maximum number initially
specified.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, supplying a single TCP URL will listen at a block of URLs
with ports starting from the supplied port number and incrementing by one
for ‘n’ specified e.g. the host URL
‘tcp://10.75.32.70:5555’ with <code>n = 6</code> listens to the
contiguous block of ports 5555 through 5560.
</p>
<p><strong>Without Dispatcher</strong>
</p>
<p>A TCP URL may be used in this case as the host listens at only one
address, utilising a single port.
</p>
<p>The network topology is such that daemons (started with
<code>daemon</code>) or indeed dispatchers (started with
<code>dispatcher</code>) dial into the same host URL.
</p>
<p>‘n’ is not required in this case, and disregarded if supplied, as
network resources may be added or removed at any time. The host
automatically distributes tasks to all connected daemons and dispatchers
in a round-robin fashion.
</p>


<h3>Compute Profiles</h3>

<p>By default, the ‘default’ compute profile is used. Providing a
character value for ‘.compute’ creates a new compute profile with
the name specified. Each compute profile retains its own daemons
settings, and may be operated independently of each other. Some usage
examples follow:
</p>
<p><strong>local / remote</strong> daemons may be set with a host URL and specifying
‘.compute’ as ‘remote’, which creates a new compute
profile. Subsequent <code>mirai</code> calls may then be sent for local
computation by not specifying the ‘.compute’ argument, or for
remote computation to connected daemons by specifying the
‘.compute’ argument as ‘remote’.
</p>
<p><strong>cpu / gpu</strong> some tasks may require access to different types of
daemon, such as those with GPUs. In this case, <code>daemons()</code> may be
called to set up host URLs for CPU-only daemons and for those with GPUs,
specifying the ‘.compute’ argument as ‘cpu’ and
‘gpu’ respectively. By supplying the ‘.compute’ argument to
subsequent <code>mirai</code> calls, tasks may be sent to either
‘cpu’ or ‘gpu’ daemons as appropriate.
</p>
<p>Note: further actions such as resetting daemons via <code>daemons(0)</code>
should be carried out with the desired ‘.compute’ argument
specified.
</p>
