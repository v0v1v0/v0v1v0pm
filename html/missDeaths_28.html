<h2>Simulating and analyzing time to event data in the presence of population mortality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In analysis of time to event data we may have a situation where we know that a 
certain non-negligible competing risk exists, but is not recorded in the data. 
Due to competing nature of the risks, ignoring such a risk may significantly 
impact the at-risk group and thus lead to biased estimates. <br><br>
This problem can be found in several national registries of benign diseases, 
medical device implantations (e.g. hip, knee or heart pacemaker) etc. where law obliges 
physicians to report events whereas the information on patient deaths is unavailable; 
it is hence unclear how many devices are still in use at a given time.<br><br>
Under the assumption that the survival of an individual is not influenced by the 
event under study, general population mortality tables can be used to obtain unbiased 
estimates of the measures of interest or to verify the assumption that the bias
introduced by the non-recorded deaths is truly negligible.<br><br>
Two approaches are implemented in the missdeaths package: <br>
- an iterative imputation method <code>md.survcox</code> and<br> 
- a mortality adjusted at risk function <code>md.survnp</code>.<br><br>
The package also includes a comprehensive set of functions to simulate data 
that can be used for better understanding of these methods (See <code>md.simulate</code>).
