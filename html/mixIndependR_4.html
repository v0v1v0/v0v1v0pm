<h2>Generate Comparison Observed and Expected No. of Shared Alleles.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generate Comparison Observed and Expected No. of Shared Alleles.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ComposPare_X(AS,Ex,trans=TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>AS</code></td>
<td>
<p>a double made up of "0","1" and "2" denoting number of shared alleles; Outcome of function "AlleleShare_Table"; Each column denotes each locus and each row denotes each pair of individuals.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Ex</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dataframe of expected density, outcome of function "DistAlleleShare", on each possible total number of shared Alleles.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trans</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logic variable, if True, the outcome is a dataframe of n x 2. n is the number of individuals of original imported database. First column is the observed No. of Heterozygous Loci and the second is the expected one. If False, the dataframe is 2n x 2, where n is the number of individuals of original imported database. The first column is a categorical variable denoting the frequency is observed or expected value; the second column is the frequency of No. of heterozygous loci.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function generates a dataframe in which the observed and expected shared alleles for each pair of individuals. The observed ones are calculated from the original dataset through "AlleleShare_Table". However, the expected ones are simulated according to the expected probability with the same sample size as the observed sample.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a dataframe of observed and expected No. of shared alleles for each pair of individuals.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">AS&lt;-matrix(sample(c(0:2),20,replace=TRUE,prob=c(0.3,0.3,0.4)),nrow=5)
Ex &lt;- data.frame(X=c(0:8),Density=rnorm(9,mean = 0.5,sd=0.05))
ComposPare_X(AS,Ex,trans = TRUE)
