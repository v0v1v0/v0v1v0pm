<h2>Responses from 1983 American National Election Survey Pilot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>ANES</code> contains political ideology survey data from the 1983 American National Election Survey Pilot. Respondents were read a value statement and asked
to report their level of agreement: ‘strongly agree’, ‘agree’, ‘can’t decide', ‘disagree’, and strongly disagree'.
The 279 complete responses to the 19 statements selected by Feldman (1988)
and reanalyzed by Gross and Manrique-Vallier (2014) are included. ‘Strongly disagree’ and ‘disagree’ as well
as ‘strongly agree’ and 'agree' have been collapsed into single categories.
0 indicates ‘agree’, 1 indicates ‘can’t decide', and 2
indicates ‘disagree’. The statements have been grouped into 3 overarching themes as
indicated in the variable names- Equality (EQ), Economic Individualism (IND), and Free Enterprise (ENT).
Variable ID's from the original ANES questionnaire are included in parentheses.
An example analysis of the data is included in the
"Fitting Mixed Membership Models Using <code>mixedMem</code>" vignette.
