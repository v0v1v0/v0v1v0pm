<h2>Point estimates from Gross and Manrique-Vallier 2014</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>gmv_theta</code> contains the point estimates for the sub-populaton response probabilities, <code class="reqn">\theta</code> from the original Gross and
Manrique-Vallier 2014 analysis. It is a 3 by 19 by 3 dimensional array with
the first dimension corresponding to each latent sub-population, the second dimension corresponding to
each variable, and the 3rd dimension corresponding to response choices (Agree, Can't Decide,
Disagree). Gross and Manrique-Vallier do not report results for group 3 for reasons discussed in the vignette
so all values for group 3 in theta[1, , ] are 0.
