<h2>Reaction Time (RT) Data Set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set involves normally developing children 9 years of age presented with two visual simuli on a computer monitor.
The left image is the target stimuli and on the right is either an exact copy or a mirror image
of the target stimuli.  The child must press one key if it is a copy or another key if it is a mirror image.  The
data consists of the reaction times (RT) of the 197 children who provided correct responses for all 6 task trials. 
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame consists of 197 children (the rows) and their 6 responses (the columns)
