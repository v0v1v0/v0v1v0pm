<h2>Tone perception data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The tone perception data stem
from an experiment of Cohen (1980) and have been analyzed in de Veaux
(1989) and Viele and Tong (2002).  The dataset and this documentation file
were copied from the fpc package by Christian Hennig.
A pure fundamental tone was played to a
trained musician. Electronically generated overtones were added, determined 
by a stretching ratio of <code>stretchratio</code>. <code>stretchratio=2.0</code>
corresponds to the harmonic pattern
usually heard in traditional definite pitched instruments. The musician was
asked to tune an adjustable tone to the octave above the fundamental tone.
<code>tuned</code> gives the ratio of the adjusted tone to the fundamental,
i.e. <code>tuned=2.0</code> would be the correct tuning for all
<code>stretchratio</code>-values.
The data analyzed here belong to 150 trials 
with the same musician. In the original study, there were four further
musicians.
