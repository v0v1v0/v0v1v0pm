<h2>Mixture Effect Predicted by IA at Particular Concentration of a Mixture</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>According to the fitted concentration-response information of mixtures. The
concentration (e.g., ECx) that causes certain effect in the mixture will 
be calculated. eiaPred will predict how much effect will be caused at 
those concentrations according to independent action.
The individual concentration-responses should be  
fitted only based on the following six models: Hill, 
Weibull, Logit, BCW, BCL, and GL.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">eiaPred(effv, sgl, mix, pctMix, sav = FALSE)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>effv</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector with single or multiple effect values (0 ~ 1).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sgl</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list with sgl$model and sgl$param. sgl$model is character vector of equations
used to fit the concentration-response data of individual chemicals: Hill, Weibull, Logit,
BCW, BCL, GL. sgl$param is numeric matrix of fitting coefficients with rownames (selected
equations) and colnames (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma). For equations with only two parameters,
Gamma can be set as zero or any other numeric value.

<td><code>mix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list with mix$model and mix$param. mix$model is character vector of equations
used to fit the concentration-response data of mixtures: Hill, Weibull, Logit, BCW, 
BCL, GL. mix$param is numeric matrix of fitting coefficients of mixtures' 
concentration-response data with rownames ( equations) and colnames 
(Alpha, Beta, and Gamma). For equations with two parameters, Gamma can 
be set as zero or any other numeric value.

<td>
<p>A numeric matrix, the concentration ratio (percent) of every component in the
mixture.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>eiaPred calculate the effect concentrations based on the fitted concentration-response
information of the mixture according to the input effects effv (e.g., 0.05 and 0.5). 
The concentration of individual component <code class="reqn">c_i</code> is computed based on 
mixture's ECx and the proportion of component in the mixture 
<code class="reqn">p_i</code>. Then the IA effect will be calculated based on the 
independent action.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric matrix of predicted effects</p>
