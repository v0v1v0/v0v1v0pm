<h2>Mixture Toxicity Prediction Based on Independent Action</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Predict the mixture toxicity based on individual concentration-response 
information fitted only based on the following six models: Hill, 
Weibull, Logit, BCW, BCL, and GL. Three optional mixture design methods 
are provided:(1)arbitrary concentration ratio (acr), users can set 
an arbitary proportion for each component in a mixture; (2)equal effect 
concentration ratio (eecr); (3) uniform design concentration ratio (udcr).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">iaPred(model, param, mixType, effv, effPoints, lb = 1e-9, ub = 6, sav = FALSE)</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>IA is designed for mixtures of chemicals that have distinct 
mechanisms of action. The IA model is commonly defined as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">{\rm{E}}({c_{mix}}) = 1 - (1 - {\rm{E}}({c_1}))(1 - {\rm{E}}({c_2})) \cdot  
		\cdot  \cdot (1 - {\rm{E}}({c_n})) = 1 - \prod\limits_{i = 1}^n {\left( {1 - 
		{\rm{E}}({c_i})} \right)}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">E\left( {{c_{mix}}} \right)</code> is the overall effect caused by <code class="reqn">c_{mix}</code>, 
and <code class="reqn">E({c_i})</code> is the effect elicited by <code class="reqn">c_i</code> when applied individually. 
For a fitted function <code class="reqn">f_i</code> based on the concentration-response data of the 
<code class="reqn">i^{th}</code> component, <code class="reqn">E({c_i})</code> is equal to <code class="reqn">{f_i}({c_i})</code>.
When <code class="reqn">E({c_{mix}}) = x</code>, the equation can be expressed as: 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">x\%  = 1 - \prod\limits_{i = 1}^n {\left( {1 - {f_i}\left( {{p_i}\left( 
		{E{C_{x,mix}}} \right)} \right)} \right)}</code>
</p>

<p>This equation can be used to predict the combined effects of mixture-components based
on IA. The dichotomy technique is used to solve the constructed equation.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Note that effv is dependent on the mixType.<br>
If the mixType is acr, effv is supposed to be a vector with the ratio of each components and its length 
should be the same as the number of components. For instance, effv can be c(4, 1) if one wants to mix two 
compounds with a ratio of 4:1. One can also set effv as c(80, 20) or c(0.8, 0.2) or any other values 
with the same ratio as 4:1. The program will convert the ratio to a range of 0 to 100%.<br>
If the mixType is eecr, effv is supposed to be the effect values. For instance, effv = c(0.5) means one mixture 
will be prepared and each of its components will be mixed in a ratio equal to EC50. More than one eecr mixtures 
can be achieved by assigning more effect values to effv, e.g., effv = c(0.05, 0.10, 0.5) <br>
If the mixType is udcr, elements in effv are levels in a uniform table, the length of effv is the same as 
the number of runs. the number of runs should be consistent with the number of components in the uniform design.
