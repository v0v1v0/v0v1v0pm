<h2>Mixture Toxicity Prediction Based on Concentration Addition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Predicting mixture toxicity based on individual concentration-response 
information fitted only based on the following six models: Hill, 
Weibull, Logit, BCW, BCL, and GL. Three optional mixture design methods 
are provided:(1)arbitrary concentration ratio (acr), users can set 
an arbitary proportion for each component in a mixture; (2)equal effect 
concentration ratio (eecr); (3) uniform design concentration ratio (udcr).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Concentration addition (CA) is designed for mixtures of chemicals that have similar 
mechanisms of action. For a well-defined mixture (e.g., a mixture of n components), 
CA is expressed mathematically as: 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\frac{{{c_i}}}{{EC{x_i}}}}  = 1</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">EC{x_i}</code> is the effect concentration of the <code class="reqn">i^{th}</code> compound that 
causes x% effect when applied individually at <code class="reqn">{c_i}</code>. The <code class="reqn">{c_i}</code> can be 
computed from the following equation:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">{c_i} = {p_i} \cdot {c_{mix}} = {p_i} \cdot E{C_{x,mix}}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">p_i</code> is the proportion of <code class="reqn">i^{th}</code> component in the mixture, 
<code class="reqn">c_{mix}</code> the mixture concentration and <code class="reqn">E{C_{x,mix}}</code> the 
concentration of the mixture at a specific effect x%. The prediction 
of combined effects of mixture-components based on 
CA can then be expressed as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">E{C_{x,mix}} = {\left( {\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {\frac{{{p_i}}}{{E{C_{x,i}}}}}} 
				\right)^{ - 1}}</code>
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Note that effv is dependent on the mixType.<br>
If the mixType is acr, effv is supposed to be a vector with the ratio of each components and its length 
should be the same as the number of components. For instance, effv can be c(4, 1) if one wants to mix two 
compounds with a ratio of 4:1. One can also set effv as c(80, 20) or c(0.8, 0.2) or any other values 
with the same ratio as 4:1. The program will convert the ratio to a range of 0 to 100%.<br>
If the mixType is eecr, effv is supposed to be the effect values. For instance, effv = c(0.5) means one mixture 
will be prepared and each of its components will be mixed in a ratio equal to EC50. More than one eecr mixtures 
can be achieved by assigning more effect values to effv, e.g., effv = c(0.05, 0.10, 0.5) <br>
If the mixType is udcr, elements in effv are levels in a uniform table, the length of effv is the same as 
the number of runs. the number of runs should be consistent with the number of components in the uniform design.
