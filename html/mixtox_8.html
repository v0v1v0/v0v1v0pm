<h2>Mixture Effect Predicted by CA at Particular Concentration of a Mixture</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>According to the fitted concentration-response information of mixtures. The 
concentration (e.g., ECx) that causes certain effect in the mixture will be
calculated. ecaPred will predict how much effect will be caused at ECx according
to concentration addition.
The individual concentration-responses should be  
fitted only based on the following six models: Hill, 
Weibull, Logit, BCW, BCL, and GL.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ecaPred(effv, sgl, mix, pctMix, sav = FALSE)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>effv</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector with single or multiple effect values (0 ~ 1).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sgl</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list with sgl$model and sgl$param. sgl$model is character vector of equations used
to fit the concentration-response data of individual chemicals: Hill, Weibull, Logit, BCW,
BCL, GL. sgl$param is numeric matrix of fitting coefficients with rownames (equations) 
and colnames (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma). For equations with only two parameters, 
Gamma can be set as zero or any other numeric value.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list with mix$model and mix$param. mix$model is character vector of equations used
to fit the concentration-response data of mixtures: Hill, Weibull, Logit, BCW, BCL, GL.
mix$param is numeric matrix of fitting coefficients of mixtures' concentration-response
data with rownames (selected equations) and colnames (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma). For 
equations with only two parameters, Gamma can be set as zero or any other numeric value.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pctMix</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric matrix, the concentration ratio (percent) of every component in the
mixture.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sav</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE: save output to a default file; FALSE: output will not be saved; 
a custom file directory: save output to the custom file directory.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ecaPred calculate the effect concentrations based on the fitted concentration-response
information of the mixture according to the input effects effv (e.g., 0.05 and 0.5). The
concentration of individual component <code class="reqn">c_i</code> is computed based on mixture's 
ECx and the proportion of component in the mixture <code class="reqn">p_i</code>. 
Then the CA effect will be calculated based 
on the concentration addition.
</p>
