<h2>A class to hold the results of a simulation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A class that holds the results of projecting a MizerParams
object through time using <code>project()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A new <code>MizerSim</code> object can be created with the <code>MizerSim()</code>
constructor, but you will never have to do that because the object is
created automatically by <code>project()</code> when needed.
</p>
<p>As a user you should never have to access the slots of a MizerSim object
directly. Instead there are a range of functions to extract the information.
<code>N()</code> and <code>NResource()</code> return arrays with the saved abundances of
the species and the resource population at size respectively. <code>getEffort()</code>
returns the fishing effort of each gear through time.
<code>getTimes()</code> returns the vector of times at which simulation results
were stored and <code>idxFinalT()</code> returns the index with which to access
specifically the value at the final time in the arrays returned by the other
functions. <code>getParams()</code> returns the <code>MizerParams</code> object that was
passed to <code>project()</code>. There are also several
summary_functions and plotting_functions
available to explore the contents of a <code>MizerSim</code> object.
</p>
<p>The arrays all have named dimensions. The names of the <code>time</code> dimension
denote the time in years. The names of the <code>w</code> dimension are weights in grams
rounded to three significant figures. The names of the <code>sp</code> dimension are the
same as the species name in the order specified in the species_params data
frame. The names of the <code>gear</code> dimension are the names of the gears, in the
same order as specified when setting up the <code>MizerParams</code> object.
</p>
<p>Extensions of mizer can use the <code>n_other</code> slot to store the abundances of
other ecosystem components and these extensions should provide their own
functions for accessing that information.
</p>
<p>The <code>MizerSim</code> class has changed since previous versions of mizer. To use
a <code>MizerSim</code> object created by a previous version, you need to upgrade it
with <code>upgradeSim()</code>.
