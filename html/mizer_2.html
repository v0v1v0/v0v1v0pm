<h2>Add new species</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-experimental.svg" alt="[Experimental]"></a>
</p>
<p>Takes a MizerParams object and adds additional species with
given parameters to the ecosystem. It sets the initial values for these new
species to their steady-state solution in the given initial state of the
existing ecosystem. This will be close to the true steady state if the
abundances of the new species are sufficiently low. Hence the abundances of
the new species are set so that they are at most 1/100th of the resource
power law. Their reproductive efficiencies are set so as to keep them at
that low level.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">addSpecies(
  params,
  species_params,
  gear_params = data.frame(),
  initial_effort,
  interaction
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>params</code></td>
<td>
<p>A mizer params object for the original system.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>species_params</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame with the species parameters of the new
species we want to add to the system.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gear_params</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame with the gear parameters for the new
species. If not provided then the new species will not be fished.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>initial_effort</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named vector with the effort for any new fishing gear
introduced in <code>gear_params</code>. Not needed if the added species are only
fished by already existing gear. Should not include effort values
for existing gear. New gear for which no effort is set via this
vector will have an initial effort of 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>interaction</code></td>
<td>
<p>Interaction matrix. A square matrix giving either the
interaction coefficients between all species or only those between the new
species. In the latter case all interaction between an old and a new
species are set to 1. If this argument is missing, all interactions
involving a new species are set to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The resulting MizerParams object will use the same size grid where
possible, but if one of the new species needs a larger range of w (either
because a new species has an egg size smaller than those of existing
species or a maximum size larger than those of existing species) then the
grid will be expanded and all arrays will be enlarged accordingly.
</p>
<p>If any of the rate arrays of the existing species had been set by the user
to values other than those calculated as default from the species
parameters, then these will be preserved. Only the rates for the new
species will be calculated from their species parameters.
</p>
<p>After adding the new species, the background species are not retuned and
the system is not run to steady state. This could be done with <code>steady()</code>.
The new species will have a reproduction level of 1/4, this can then be
changed with <code>setBevertonHolt()</code>
</p>
