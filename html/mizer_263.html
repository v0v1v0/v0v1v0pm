<h2>Upgrade MizerParams object from earlier mizer versions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Occasionally during the development of new features for mizer, the
MizerParams object gains extra slots. MizerParams objects
created in older versions of mizer are then no longer valid in the new
version because of the missing slots. You need to upgrade them with
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>params &lt;- upgradeParams(params)
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>params</code> should be replaced by the name of your MizerParams object.
This function adds the missing slots and fills them with default values. Any
object from version 0.4 onwards can be upgraded. Any old
MizerSim objects should be similarly updated with
<code>upgradeSim()</code>. This function uses <code>newMultispeciesParams()</code> to create a new
MizerParams object using the parameters extracted from the old MizerParams
object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">upgradeParams(params)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>params</code></td>
<td>
<p>An old MizerParams object to be upgraded</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The upgraded MizerParams object
</p>


<h3>Backwards compatibility</h3>

<p>The internal numerics in mizer have changed over time, so there may be small
discrepancies between the results obtained with the upgraded object
in the new version and the original object in the old version. If it
is important for you to reproduce the exact results then you should install
the version of mizer with which you obtained the results. You can do this
with
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>remotes::install_github("sizespectrum/mizer", ref = "v0.2")
</pre></div>
<p>where you should replace "v0.2" with the version number you require. You can
see the list of available releases at
<a href="https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/tags">https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/tags</a>.
</p>
<p>If you only have a serialised version of the old object, for example
created via <code>saveRDS()</code>, and you get an error when trying to read it in
with <code>readRDS()</code> then unfortunately you will need to install the old version
of mizer first to read the params object into your workspace, then switch
to the current version and then call <code>upgradeParams()</code>. You can then save
the new version again with <code>saveRDS()</code>.
