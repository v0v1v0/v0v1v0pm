<h2>Upgrade MizerSim object from earlier mizer versions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Occasionally, during the development of new features for mizer, the
MizerSim class or the MizerParams class gains
extra slots. MizerSim objects created in older versions of mizer are then no
longer valid in the new version because of the missing slots. You need to
upgrade them with
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>sim &lt;- upgradeSim(sim)
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>sim</code> should be replaced by the name of your MizerSim object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">upgradeSim(sim)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sim</code></td>
<td>
<p>An old MizerSim object to be upgraded</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function adds the missing slots and fills them with default values. It
calls <code>upgradeParams()</code> to upgrade the MizerParams object inside the MizerSim
object. Any object from version 0.4 onwards can be upgraded.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The upgraded MizerSim object
</p>


<h3>Backwards compatibility</h3>

<p>The internal numerics in mizer have changed over time, so there may be small
discrepancies between the results obtained with the upgraded object
in the new version and the original object in the old version. If it
is important for you to reproduce the exact results then you should install
the version of mizer with which you obtained the results. You can do this
with
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>remotes::install_github("sizespectrum/mizer", ref = "v0.2")
</pre></div>
<p>where you should replace "v0.2" with the version number you require. You can
see the list of available releases at
<a href="https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/tags">https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer/tags</a>.
</p>
<p>If you only have a serialised version of the old object, for example
created via <code>saveRDS()</code>, and you get an error when trying to read it in
with <code>readRDS()</code> then unfortunately you will need to install the old version
of mizer first to read the params object into your workspace, then switch
to the current version and then call <code>upgradeParams()</code>. You can then save
the new version again with <code>saveRDS()</code>.
