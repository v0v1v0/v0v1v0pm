<h2>
Synthetic datasets for one parent compound with two metabolites
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 12 datasets were generated using four different models and three different
variance components. The four models are either the SFO or the DFOP model with either
two sequential or two parallel metabolites.
</p>
<p>Variance component 'a' is based on a normal distribution with standard deviation of 3,
Variance component 'b' is also based on a normal distribution, but with a standard deviation of 7.
Variance component 'c' is based on the error model from Rocke and Lorenzato (1995), with the
minimum standard deviation (for small y values) of 0.5, and a proportionality constant of 0.07
for the increase of the standard deviation with y. Note that this is a simplified version
of the error model proposed by Rocke and Lorenzato (1995), as in their model the error of the
measured values approximates lognormal distribution for high values, whereas we are using
normally distributed error components all along.
</p>
<p>Initial concentrations for metabolites and all values where adding the variance component resulted
in a value below the assumed limit of detection of 0.1 were set to <code>NA</code>.
</p>
<p>As an example, the first dataset has the title <code>SFO_lin_a</code> and is based on the SFO model
with two sequential metabolites (linear pathway), with added variance component 'a'.
</p>
<p>Compare also the code in the example section to see the degradation models.
