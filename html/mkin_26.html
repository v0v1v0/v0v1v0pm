Experimental datasets used for development and testing of error models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 12 datasets were extracted from active substance evaluation dossiers published
by EFSA. Kinetic evaluations shown for these datasets are intended to illustrate
and advance error model specifications. The fact that these data and some
results are shown here do not imply a license to use them in the context of
pesticide registrations, as the use of the data may be constrained by
data protection regulations.
</p>
<p>Preprocessing of data was performed based on the recommendations of the FOCUS
kinetics workgroup (FOCUS, 2014) as described below.
</p>
<p>Datasets 1 and 2 are from the Renewal Assessment Report (RAR) for imazamox
(France, 2015, p. 15). For setting values reported as zero, an LOQ of 0.1
was assumed. Metabolite residues reported for day zero were added to the
parent compound residues.
</p>
<p>Datasets 3 and 4 are from the Renewal Assessment Report (RAR) for isofetamid
(Belgium, 2014, p. 8) and show the data for two different radiolabels. For
dataset 4, the value given for the metabolite in the day zero sampling
in replicate B was added to the parent compound, following the respective
FOCUS recommendation.
</p>
<p>Dataset 5 is from the Renewal Assessment Report (RAR) for ethofumesate
(Austria, 2015, p. 16).
</p>
<p>Datasets 6 to 10 are from the Renewal Assessment Report (RAR) for glyphosate
(Germany, 2013, pages 8, 28, 50, 51). For the initial sampling,
the residues given for the metabolite were added to the parent
value, following the recommendation of the FOCUS kinetics workgroup.
</p>
<p>Dataset 11 is from the Renewal Assessment Report (RAR) for 2,4-D
(Hellas, 2013, p. 644). Values reported as zero were set to NA, with
the exception of the day three sampling of metabolite A2, which was set
to one half of the LOD reported to be 1% AR.
</p>
<p>Dataset 12 is from the Renewal Assessment Report (RAR) for thifensulfuron-methyl
(United Kingdom, 2014, p. 81).
