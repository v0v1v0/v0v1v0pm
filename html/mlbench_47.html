<h2>Shuttle Dataset (Statlog version)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The shuttle dataset contains 9 attributes all of which are
numerical with the first one being time.  The last column is the class
with the following 7 levels: Rad.Flow, Fpv.Close, Fpv.Open, High, Bypass,
Bpv.Close, Bpv.Open.
</p>
<p>Approximately 80% of the data belongs to class 1. Therefore the
default accuracy is about 80%. The aim here is to obtain an
accuracy of 99 - 99.9%.
</p>
