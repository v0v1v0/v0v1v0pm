<h2>Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their
study of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network
[1]. The task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar
signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly
cylindrical rock.  
</p>
<p>Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Each
number represents the energy within a particular frequency band,
integrated over a certain period of time. The integration aperture
for higher frequencies occur later in time, since these frequencies
are transmitted later during the chirp.
</p>
<p>The label associated with each record contains the letter "R" if the
object is a rock and "M" if it is a mine (metal cylinder). The
numbers in the labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but
they do not encode the angle directly. 
</p>
