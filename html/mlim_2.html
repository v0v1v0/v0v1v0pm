<h2>Manifest Anxiety Scale</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale was first developed in 1953 to identify
individuals who would be good subjects for studies of stress and other
related psychological phenomenon. Since then it has been used as a measure of
anxiety as general personality trait. Anxiety is a complex psychological
construct that includes a multiple of different facets related to extensive
worrying that may impair normal functioning. The test has been widely studied
and used in research, however there are some concerns that it does not measure
a single trait, but instead, measures a basket of loosely related ones and so
the score is not that meaningful.
