<h2>MotorImagery</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Multivariate time series (MTS) involving imagined movements performed by a subject with either the left small finger or the
tongue. The time series of the electrical brain activity were stored during the corresponding trials
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(MotorImagery)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>list</code> with two elements, which are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>data</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A list with 378 MTS.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>classes</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector indicating the corresponding classes associated with the elements in <code>data</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each element in <code>data</code> is a matrix formed by 3000 rows (time points) indicating time recordings in EEG and 64 columns
(variables) indicating EEG electrodes. The first 278 elements correspond to the training set, whereas the last 100 elements
correspond to the test set. The numeric vector <code>classes</code> is formed by integers from 1 to 2, indicating that there are 2
different classes in the database. Each class is associated with the label 'finger' or 'tongue' (the imagined movements).
For more information, see Bagnall et al. (2018).
To access this dataset, execute the code "install.packages("ueadata2", repos="https://anloor7.github.io/drat")"
and use the following syntax: "ueadata2::MotorImagery".
