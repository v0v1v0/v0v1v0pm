<h2>RacketSports</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Multivariate time series (MTS) collected from university students playing badminton or squash while wearing a
smartwatch. The watch recorded the x, y, z coordinates for both a gyroscope and an accelerometer to an android phone.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(RacketSports)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>list</code> with two elements, which are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>data</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A list with 303 MTS.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>classes</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector indicating the corresponding classes associated with the elements in <code>data</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each element in <code>data</code> is a matrix formed by 30 rows (time points) indicating time recordings over an interval of 3 seconds
and 6 columns (variables) indicating gyroscope or accelerometer and the corresponding coordinate. The first 151 elements correspond to the
training set, whereas the last 152 elements correspond to the test set. The numeric vector <code>classes</code> is formed by integers from 1 to 4,
indicating that there are 4 different classes in the database. Each class is associated with a sport and stroke a particular player is making.
