<h2>SelfRegulationSCP2</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Multivariate time series (MTS) taken from an Amyotrophyc Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) subject asked to move a cursor up and down
on a computer screen while his cortical potentials were taken.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(SelfRegulationSCP1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>list</code> with two elements, which are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>data</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A list with 380 MTS.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>classes</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector indicating the corresponding classes associated with the elements in <code>data</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each element in <code>data</code> is a matrix formed by 1152 rows (time points) indicating time recordings over an interval of 4.5 seconds
and 7 columns (variables) indicating EEG channel. The first 200 elements correspond to the training set, whereas the last 180 elements
correspond to the test set. The numeric vector <code>classes</code> is formed by integers from 1 to 2, indicating that there are 2
different classes in the database. Each class is associated with the label 'negativity' (downward movement of the cursor) or 'positivity'
(upward movement of the cursor). For more information, see Bagnall et al. (2018).
