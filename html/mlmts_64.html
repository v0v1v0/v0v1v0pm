<h2>SyntheticData1</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Synthetic dataset containing 60 MTS generated from four
different generating processes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(SyntheticData1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>list</code> with two elements, which are:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>data</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A list with 60 MTS.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>classes</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric vector indicating the corresponding classes associated with the elements in <code>data</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each element in <code>data</code> is a matrix formed by 400 rows (series length)
and 2 columns (dimensions). Series 1-15 were generated from a VAR(1) process
and series 16-30 were generated from a VMA(1) process. Series 31-45 were
generated from a QVAR(1) process and series 46-60 were generated from a different
QVAR(1) process. Therefore, there are 4 different classes in the dataset.
