<h2>Adult Dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dataset used to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.
Also known as "Census Income" dataset
Train dataset contains 13 features and 30178 observations.
Test dataset contains 13 features and 15315 observations.
Target column is "target": A binary factor where 1: &lt;=50K and 2: &gt;50K for annual income.
The column <code>"sex"</code> is set as protected attribute.
</p>


<h3>Derived tasks</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>adult_train</code>: Original train split for the adult task available at UCI.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>adult_test</code>: Original test split for the adult task available at UCI.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using Adult - Known Problems</h3>

<p>The adult dataset has several known limitations such as its age, limited documentation, and outdated feature encodings (Ding et al., 2021).
Furthermore, the selected threshold (income &lt;=50K) has strong implications on the outcome of analysis, such that
"In many cases, the $50k threshold understates and misrepresents the broader picture" (Ding et al., 2021).
As a result, conclusions w.r.t. real-world implications are severely limited.
</p>
<p>We decide to replicate the dataset here, as it is a widely used benchmark dataset and it can still serve this purpose.
</p>


<h3>Pre-processing</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>fnlwgt</code> Remove final weight, which is the number of people the census believes the entry represents
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>native-country</code> Remove Native Country, which is the country of origin for an individual
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Rows containing <code>NA</code> in workclass and occupation have been removed.
