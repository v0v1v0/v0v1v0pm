<h2>Cookfarm Profiles Regression Task</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The R.J. Cook Agronomy Farm (cookfarm) is a Long-Term Agroecosystem Research
Site operated by Washington State University, located near Pullman,
Washington, USA. Contains spatio-temporal (3D+T) measurements of three soil
properties and a number of spatial and temporal regression covariates.
</p>
<p>Here, only the "Profiles" dataset is used from the collection.
The <code>Date</code> column was appended from the <code>readings</code> dataset.
In addition coordinates were appended to the task as variables <code>"x"</code> and <code>"y"</code>.
</p>
<p>The dataset was borrowed and adapted from package GSIF which was on archived on
CRAN in 2021-03.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(cookfarm_mlr3)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>R6::R6Class inheriting from TaskRegr.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre>mlr_tasks$get("cookfarm")
tsk("cookfarm_mlr3")
</pre></div>


<h3>Column roles</h3>

<p>The task has set column roles "space" and "time" for variables <code>"Date"</code> and
<code>"SOURCEID"</code>, respectively.
These are used by certain methods during partitioning, e.g.,
<code>mlr_resamplings_sptcv_cstf</code> with variant "Leave-location-and-time-out".
If only one of space or time should left out, the column roles must be
adjusted by the user!
