<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following provides some details on the different choices of measures.
</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>
The default <code>measures</code> depend on the type of task. Therefore, NULL is displayed as default and
the measures will be initialized in <code>summary.Learner</code> with the help of <code>mlr3::msr</code>.
The following provides an overview of these defaults:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Regression: regr.rmse,
regr.rsq,
regr.mae,
regr.medae
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binary classification with probabilities:
classif.auc,
classif.fbeta,
classif.bbrier,
classif.mcc
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Binary classification with hard labels:
classif.acc,
classif.bacc,
classif.fbeta,
classif.mcc
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-class classification with probabilities:
classif.mauc_aunp,
classif.mbrier
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Complexity</strong>
Currently only two <code>complexity_measures</code> are available, which are
based on Molnar et al. (2020):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>sparsity</code>: The number of used features, that have a non-zero effect
on the prediction (evaluated by accumulated local effects (ale, Apley and Zhu
(2020)). The measure can have values between 0 and the number of features.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>interaction_strength</code>: The scaled approximation error between a
main effect model (based on ale) and the prediction function. It can have
values between 0 and 1, where 0 means no interaction and 1 only interaction,
and no main effects. Interaction strength can only be measured for binary
classification and regression models.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Importance</strong> The <code>importance_measures</code> are based on the <code>iml</code> and
<code>fastshap</code> packages. Multiple measures are available:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>pdp: This corrensponds to importances based on the standard deviations
in partial dependence plots (Friedmann (2001)), as proposed by Greenwell et al. (2018).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pfi.<code>&lt;</code>loss<code>&gt;</code>: This corresponds to the permutation feature importance as
implemented in iml::FeatureImp. Different loss functions are possible and
rely on the task at hand.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shap: This importance corresponds to the
mean absolute Shapley values computed with fastshap::explain.
Higher values display higher importance.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NULL is the default, corresponding to importance calculations based on pdp and pfi.
Because the loss function for pfi relies on the task at hand, the importance measures
are initialized in <code>summary</code>."pdp" and "pfi.ce" are the defaults for
classification, "pdp" and "pfi.mse" for regression.
</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong> The <code>effect_measures</code> are based on iml::FeatureEffects.
Currently partial dependence plots (pdp) and accumulated local effects are
available (ale). Ale has the advantage over pdp that it takes feature
correlations into account but has a less natural interpretation than pdp.
Therefore, both "pdp" and "ale" are the defaults.
</p>
<p><strong>Fairness</strong>
The default <code>fairness_measures</code> depend on the type of task.
Therefore, NULL is displayed as default and
the measures will be initialized in <code>summary.Learner</code> based on
mlr3fairness::mlr_measures_fairness.
There is currently a mismatch between the naming convention of
measures in <code>mlr3fairness</code> and the underlying measurements displayed.
To avoid confusion, the id of the fairness measures were adapted.
The following provides an overview of these defaults and adapted names:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Binary classification: "fairness.dp" (demographic parity) based on "fairness.cv",
"fairness.cuae" (conditional use accuracy equality) based on "fairness.pp",
"fairness.eod" (equalized odds) based on "fairness.eod". Smaller values are better.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multi-class classification: "fairness.acc", the smallest absolute
difference in accuracy between groups of the <code>protected_attribute</code>.
Smaller values are better.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regression: "fairness.rmse" and "fairness.mae",
the smallest absolute difference (see mlr3fairness::groupdiff_absdiff)
in the either the root mean-squared error (rmse) or
the mean absolute error (mae) between groups of the <code>protected_attribute</code>.
Smaller values are better.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
