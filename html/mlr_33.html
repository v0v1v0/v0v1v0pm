<h2>Performance measures.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A performance measure is evaluated after a single train/predict step and
returns a single number to assess the quality of the prediction (or maybe
only the model, think AIC). The measure itself knows whether it wants to be
minimized or maximized and for what tasks it is applicable.
</p>
<p>All supported measures can be found by listMeasures or as a table in the
tutorial appendix: <a href="https://mlr.mlr-org.com/articles/tutorial/measures.html">https://mlr.mlr-org.com/articles/tutorial/measures.html</a>.
</p>
<p>If you want a measure for a misclassification cost matrix, look at
makeCostMeasure. If you want to implement your own measure, look at
makeMeasure.
</p>
<p>Most measures can directly be accessed via the function named after the
scheme measureX (e.g. measureSSE).
</p>
<p>For clustering measures, we compact the predicted cluster IDs such that they
form a continuous series starting with 1. If this is not the case, some of
the measures will generate warnings.
</p>
<p>Some measure have parameters. Their defaults are set in the constructor
makeMeasure and can be overwritten using setMeasurePars.
