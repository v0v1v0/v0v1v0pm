<h2>Computes one single factor that is needed for full Bayesian inferencing.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In an equation such as P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), the target
feature is A, while the conditional feature is B. There are three factors in that
equation (two in the numerator and one in the denominator). This function
calculates exactly one factor and expects all features to be given in the
right order. If computing the denominator, no target-feature is required.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bayesComputeProductFactor(
  df,
  conditionalFeatures,
  targetFeature,
  computeNumerator,
  retainMinValues = 1,
  doEcdf = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame with data that is used to segment</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conditionalFeatures</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame with Bayesian features, as produced
by @seealso <code>mmb::createFeatureForBayes()</code>. This data.frame must not
be empty, as we need to depend on at least one feature.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>targetFeature</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame with exactly one Bayesian feature. Any
excessive features are discarded and a warning is produced. If computing a
factor for the denominator, this data.frame may be empty.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>computeNumerator</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean to indicate whether a factor for the
numerator is build. In that case, the target feature is required.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>retainMinValues</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer the amount of rows to minimally retain
during segmenting using the conditional features.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>doEcdf</code></td>
<td>
<p>default FALSE a boolean to indicate whether to use the
empirical CDF to return a probability when inferencing a continuous
feature. If false, uses the empirical PDF to return the rel. likelihood.
This parameter does not have any effect when inferring discrete values.
Using the ECDF, a probability to find a value less than or equal to the
given value is returned. Setting this parameter to true in conjunction
with a non-zero shiftAmount must be done with caution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>numeric the factor as probability or relative likelihood. If the
target feature is discrete, a probability is returned; a relative
likelihood, otherwise.
