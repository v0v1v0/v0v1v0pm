<h2>Given Bayesian features, returns those samples from a dataset that
exhibit a similarity (i.e., the neighborhood).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The neighborhood <code class="reqn">N_i</code> is defined as the set of samples that
have a similarity greater than zero to the given sample <code class="reqn">s_i</code>. Segmentation
is done using equality (<code>==</code>) for discrete features and less than or equal
(<code>&lt;=</code>) for continuous features. Note that feature values <code>NA</code> and <code>NaN</code>
are also supported using <code>is.na()</code> and <code>is.nan()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">neighborhood(df, features, selectedFeatureNames = c(), retainMinValues = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame to select the neighborhood from</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>features</code></td>
<td>
<p>data.frame of Bayes-features, used to segment/select the
rows that should make up the neighborhood.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>selectedFeatureNames</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of names of features to use to demarcate
the neighborhood. If empty, uses all features' names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>retainMinValues</code></td>
<td>
<p>DEFAULT 0 the amount of samples to retain during
segmentation. For separating a neighborhood, this value typically should
be 0, so that no samples are included that are not within it. However,
for very sparse data or a great amount of variables, it might still make
sense to retain samples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>data.frame with rows that were selected as neighborhood. It is
guaranteed that the rownames are maintained.
