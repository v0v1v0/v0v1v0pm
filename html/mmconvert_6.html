<h2>Array annotation information for the mouse MUGA arrays
in mouse genome build 39.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list of four data frames with annotation information for the four MUGA arrays,
GigaMUGA ("gm"), MegaMUGA ("mm"), MiniMUGA ("mini") and the original MUGA ("muga").
Each has columns marker, chromosome, build 39 basepair position, and sex-averaged cM position (in Cox Map v3).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>SNP probes for the MUGA arrays were blasted against mouse genome
build GRCm39 and locations interpolated using revised Cox maps.
See <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/MUGAarrays">https://github.com/kbroman/MUGAarrays</a> for the array
annotations and <a href="https://github.com/kbroman/CoxMapV3">https://github.com/kbroman/CoxMapV3</a> for the
genetic maps. Note that for the genetic map locations, markers were
shifted so that 0 cM corresponds to 3 Mbp, using the chromosome-
and sex-specific recombination rate. Moreover, the Cox map
positions were smoothed slightly to avoid regions with 0
recombination.
