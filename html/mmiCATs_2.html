<h2>Column Swap in CloseCATs Game Grid</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This internal function performs a column swap in the CloseCATs game grid.
It is designed to allow the player to swap the cards in their column (column 2).
This swap changes the contribution of the cards to the random slope variance
and the covariance between the random slope and the random intercept. The
function modifies the order of cards in the specified column by reversing their
positions.
</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>swap_in_col</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column number where the swap should be performed. If
