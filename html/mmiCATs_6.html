<h2>Deal Cards to CloseCATs Game Grid</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This internal function deals cards to a 2 x 2 grid for the CloseCATs game.
The game involves a deck of cards, where cards are dealt to both the computer
and the player. The matrix format of the game grid is such that column 1 is
for the computer, and column 2 is for the player. The first row of cards
contributes to the random slope variance, and the second row contributes to
the covariance between the random slope and the random intercept.
