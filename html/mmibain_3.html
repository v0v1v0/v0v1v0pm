<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>deck</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame representing a deck of cards, which by default is a
shuffled standard deck from the <code>mmcards</code> package.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of card pairs to deal. The function will deal 2*n cards
and arrange them into two rows, for the RepliCrisis grid.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function first checks if there are enough cards in the deck to deal the
required number of pairs. If not, it stops with an error. Then, it deals 2*n
cards from the provided deck, reshaping them into a 2-row matrix where each
column represents a pair of cards.
</p>
<p>If no deck is provided, the function will shuffle a standard deck using
functions from the <code>mmcards</code> package. The default deck includes all standard
52 playing cards.
</p>
<p>The grid of cards will be used by the generate_study_data function to generate
data for n groups where the values for each group are simulated from a normal
distribution with mean and standard deviation defined by the values in the card
pair.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with two rows and n columns, representing the dealt cards
arranged into pairs.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Deal a grid with 3 card pairs
grid &lt;- deal_cards_to_rc_grid(n = 3)
</code></pre>
