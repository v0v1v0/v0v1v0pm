<h2>Produce bootstrap samples from each subpopulation of a genind object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function produces bootstrap samples from a genind object, with each
subpopulation resampled according to its size. Because there are many 
statistics that you may wish to calculte from these samples, this function
returns a list of genind objects representing bootsrap samples that can then
be futher processed (see examples).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">chao_bootstrap(x, nreps = 1000)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>genind object (from package adegenet)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nreps</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric number of bootstrap replicates to perform (default 1000)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>You should note, this is a standard (frequentist) approach to quantifying
uncertainty - effectively asking "if the population was exactly like our
sample, and we repeatedly took samples like this from it, how much would 
those samples vary?" The confidence intervals don't include uncertainty 
produced from any biases in the way you collected your data. 
Additionally, this boostrapping procedure displays a slight upward bias for 
some datasets. If you plan or reporting a confidence interval for your 
statistic, it is  probably a good idea to subtract the difference between 
the point estimate of the statistic and the mean of the boostrap distribution 
from the extremes of the interval (as demonstrated in the expample below)
