<h2>mnis: Easy Downloading Capabilities for the Member Name Information Service</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An API package for the Members' Name Information Service operated by the
UK parliament. The package is intended to simplify pulling data from an API
for users unfamiliar with APIs. Documentation for the API itself can be
found here: http://data.parliament.uk/membersdataplatform/default.aspx.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package includes a built in function to remove a byte-order mark from
the API data, and a parameter <code>tidy</code> with each function that converts
variable names into an R friendly style, removing non-alphanumeric
characters and converting to snake_case when equal to <code>TRUE</code>,
its default value.
</p>
<p>All functions requests data in JSON format and parse it to a tibble. The
exception is <code>mnis_constituency_results()</code> which returns a
single object containing a list (with constituency details) and a
tibble (with election results).
</p>
<p>None of the functions included in this package appear to run into the
API rate limit, although there may be restrictions to custom requests,
which allow a maximum of three parameters.
