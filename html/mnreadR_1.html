<h2>Reading ACCessibility Index (ACC) calculation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the Reading Accessibility Index, while applying suited rules for missing data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">accIndex(data, print_size, reading_time, errors, ... = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of your dataframe</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>print_size</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable that contains print size values for each sentence (print size uncorrected for viewing distance)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reading_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable that contains the reading time for each sentence</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>errors</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable that contains the number of errors for each sentence</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional grouping arguments</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a new dataframe with a variable called "ACC" that contains the Reading Accessibility Index estimate.
</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>The Reading ACCessibility Index (ACC) is a new measure representing an individual's access to text over the range of print sizes found in everyday life.
Its calculation does not rely on curve fitting and gives a direct comparison with the performance of normally sighted individuals.
The ACC calculation uses the print size values non corrected for non-standard viewing distance.
</p>
<p>For more details on the Reading Accessibility Index, see http://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2015.6097
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>To ensure that missing data are handled properly and that ACC calculation is correct, data need to be entered along certain rules:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> For the smallest print size that is presented but not read, right before the test is stopped: <strong>reading_time = NA, errors = 10</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For all the small sentences that are not presented because the test was stopped before them: <strong>reading_time = NA, errors = NA</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If a sentence is presented, and read, but the time was not recorded by the experimenter: <strong>reading_time = NA, errors = actual number of errors</strong> (cf. s5-regular in low vision data sample)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If a large sentence was skipped to save time but would have been read well: <strong>reading_time = NA, errors = NA</strong> (cf. s1-regular in normal vision data sample)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If a large sentence was skipped to save time because the subject cannot read large print: <strong>reading_time = NA, errors = 10</strong> (cf. s7 in low vision data sample)
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># inspect the structure of the dataframe
head(data_low_vision, 10)

#------

# restrict dataset to one MNREAD test only (subject s1, regular polarity)
data_s1 &lt;- data_low_vision %&gt;%
   filter (subject == "s1", polarity == "regular")

# run the reading accessibility index calculation
data_low_vision_ACC &lt;- accIndex(data_s1, ps, rt, err)

# inspect the newly created dataframe
data_low_vision_ACC

#------

# run the reading accessibility index calculation
# on the whole dataset grouped by subject and polarity
data_low_vision_ACC &lt;- accIndex(data_low_vision, ps, rt, err,
                               subject, polarity)

# inspect the structure of the newly created dataframe
head(data_low_vision_ACC, 10)
