<p><strong>BIODIVERSITY INDICES</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>S_n: Rarefied species richness</strong> is the expected number of species, given a
defined number of sampled individuals (n) (Gotelli &amp; Colwell 2001). Rarefied
richness at the alpha-scale is calculated for the values provided in 
<code>effort_samples</code> as long as these values are not smaller than the 
user-defined minimum value <code>effort_min</code>. In this case the minimum value 
is used and samples with less individuals are discarded. When no values for
<code>effort_samples</code> are provided the observed minimum number of individuals
of the samples is used, which is the standard in rarefaction analysis
(Gotelli &amp; Colwell 2001). Because the number of individuals is expected to
scale linearly with sample area or effort, at the gamma-scale the number of
individuals for rarefaction is calculated as the minimum number of samples
within groups multiplied by <code>effort_samples</code>. For example, when there are 10
samples within each group, <code>effort_groups</code> equals <code>10 *
effort_samples</code>. If n is larger than the number of individuals in sample and
<code>extrapolate = TRUE</code> then the Chao1 (Chao 1984, Chao 1987) method is
used to extrapolate the rarefaction curve.
</p>
<p><strong>pct_rare: Percent of rare species</strong> Is the ratio of the number of rare
species to the number of observed species x 100 (McGill 2011). Species are 
considered rare in a particular sample if they have fewer individuals than 
<code>rare_thres * N</code> where <code>rare_thres</code> can be set by the user and 
<code>N</code> is the total number of individuals in the sample. The default value 
of <code>rare_thres</code> of 0.05 is arbitrary and was chosen because McGill 
(2011) found this metric of rarity performed well and was generally less 
correlated with other common metrics of biodiversity. Essentially this metric
attempt to estimate what proportion of the species in the same occur in the
tail of the species abundance distribution and is therefore sensitive to
presence of rare species.
</p>
<p><strong>S_asymp: Asymptotic species richness</strong> is the expected number of 
species given complete sampling and here it is calculated using the Chao1
estimator (Chao 1984, Chao 1987) see <code>calc_chao1</code>. Note: this metric
is typically highly correlated with S (McGill 2011).
</p>
<p><strong>f_0: Undetected species richness</strong> is the number of undetected species
or the number of species observed 0 times which is an indicator of the degree
of rarity in the community. If there is a greater rarity then f_0 is expected
to increase. This metric is calculated as <code>S_asymp - S</code>. This metric is less 
correlated with S than the raw <code>S_asymp</code> metric. 
</p>
<p><strong>PIE: Probability of intraspecific encounter</strong> represents the
probability that two randomly drawn individuals belong to the same species.
Here we use the definition of Hurlbert (1971), which considers sampling
without replacement. PIE is closely related to the well-known Simpson
diversity index, but the latter assumes sampling with replacement.
</p>
<p><strong>S_PIE: Effective number of species for PIE</strong> represents the effective
number of species derived from the PIE. It is calculated using the asymptotic
estimator for Hill numbers of diversity order 2 (Chao et al, 2014). S_PIE
represents the species richness of a hypothetical community with
equally-abundant species and infinitely many individuals corresponding to the
same value of PIE as the real community. An intuitive interpretation of S_PIE
is that it corresponds to the number of dominant (highly abundant) species in
the species pool.
</p>
<p>For species richness <code>S</code>, rarefied richness <code>S_n</code>, undetected
richness <code>f_0</code>, and the Effective Number of Species <code>S_PIE</code> we also
calculate beta-diversity using multiplicative partitioning (Whittaker 1972,
Jost 2007). That means for these indices we estimate beta-diversity as the
ratio of gamma-diversity (total diversity across all plots) divided by
alpha-diversity (i.e., average plot diversity).
</p>
<p><strong>PERMUTATION TESTS AND BOOTSTRAP</strong>
</p>
<p>For both the alpha and gamma scale analyses we summarize effect size in each
biodiversity index by computing <code>D_bar</code>: the average absolute difference
between the groups. At the alpha scale the indices are averaged first before
computing <code>D_bar</code>.
</p>
<p>We used permutation tests for testing differences of the biodiversity
statistics among the groups (Legendre &amp; Legendre 1998). At the alpha-scale,
one-way ANOVA (i.e. F-test) is implemented by shuffling treatment group
labels across samples. The test statistic for this test is the F-statistic
which is a pivotal statistic (Legendre &amp; Legendre 1998). At the gamma-scale
we carried out the permutation test by shuffling the treatment group labels
and using <code>D_bar</code> as the test statistic. We could not use the
F-statistic as the test statistic at the gamma scale because at this scale
there are no replicates and therefore the F-statistic is undefined.
</p>
<p>A bootstrap approach can be used to also test differences at the gamma-scale.
When <code>boot_groups = TRUE</code> instead of the gamma-scale permutation test,
there will be resampling of samples within groups to derive gamma-scale
confidence intervals for all biodiversity indices. The function output
includes lower and upper confidence bounds and the median of the bootstrap
samples. Please note that for the richness indices sampling with replacement
corresponds to rarefaction to ca. 2/3 of the individuals, because the same
samples occur several times in the resampled data sets.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of class <code>mob_stats</code> that contains alpha-scale and 
gamma-scale biodiversity statistics, as well as the p-values for
permutation tests at both scales.
</p>
<p>When <code>boot_groups = TRUE</code> there are no p-values at the gamma-scale.
Instead there is lower bound, median, and upper bound for each biodiversity
index derived from the bootstrap within groups.
