<h2>Generate a null community matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Three  null models are implemented that randomize different components of
community structure while keeping other components constant.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_null_comm(comm, null_model, groups = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comm</code></td>
<td>
<p>community matrix of abundances with plots as rows and species columns.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>null_model</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string which specifies which null model to use options
include: <code>'rand_SAD'</code>, <code>'rand_N'</code>, and <code>'rand_agg'</code>. See 
Details for description of each null model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groups</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional argument that is a vector of group ids which specify
which group each site is associated with. If is <code>NULL</code> then all rows
of the community matrix are assumed to be members of the same group</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function implements three different nested null models. They are considered
nested because at the core of each null model is the random sampling 
with replacement of the relative abundance distribution (RAD) to generate 
a random sample of a species abundance distribution (SAD). Here we describe
each null model:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>'rand_SAD'</code> ... A random SAD is generated using a sample with
replacement of individuals from the species pool proportional to their
observed relative abundance. This null model will produce an SAD that is
of a similar functional form to the observed SAD (Green and Plotkin 2007).
The total abundance of the random SAD is the same as the observed SAD but
overall species richness will be equal to or less than the observed SAD.
This algorithm ignores the <code>group</code> argument. This sampling algorithm
is also used in the two other null models <code>'rand_N'</code> and
<code>'rand_agg'</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>'rand_N'</code> ... The total number of individuals in a plot is
shuffled across all plots (within and between groups). Then for each plot
that many individuals are drawn randomly from the group specific relative
abundance distribution with replacement for each plot (i.e., using the
<code>'rand_SAD'</code> algorithm described above. This removes group
differences in the total number of individuals in a given plot, but
maintains group level differences in their SADs.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>'rand_agg'</code> ... This null model nullifies the spatial
structure of individuals (i.e., their aggregation), but it is constrained
by the observed total number of individuals in each plot (in contrast to
the <code>'rand_N'</code> null model), and the group specific SAD (in contrast
to the <code>'rand_SAD'</code> null model). The other two null models also
nullify spatial structure. The <code>'rand_agg'</code> null model is identical
to the <code>'rand_N'</code> null model except that plot abundances are not 
shuffled. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Replaces depreciated function 'permute_comm'
