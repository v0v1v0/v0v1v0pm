<h2>Rarefied Species Richness</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The expected number of species given a particular number of individuals or
samples under random and spatially explicit nearest neighbor sampling
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rarefaction(
  x,
  method,
  effort = NULL,
  coords = NULL,
  latlong = NULL,
  dens_ratio = 1,
  extrapolate = FALSE,
  return_NA = FALSE,
  quiet_mode = FALSE,
  spat_algo = NULL,
  sd = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>can either be a: 1) mob_in object, 2) community matrix-like
object in which rows represent plots and columns represent species, or 3)
a vector which contains the abundance of each species.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string that specifies the method of rarefaction 
curve construction it can be one of the following: 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>'IBR'</code> ... individual-based rarefaction in which species
are accumulated by randomly sampling individuals
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>'SBR'</code> ... sample-based rarefaction in which species are 
accumulated by randomly sampling samples (i.e., plots). Note that within plot spatial 
aggregation is maintained with this approach. Although this curve
is implemented here, it is not used in the current version of the MoB framework
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>'nsSBR'</code> ... non-spatial, sampled-based rarefaction in which
species are accumulated by randomly sampling samples that represent a 
spatially random sample of individuals (i.e., no with-in plot spatial 
aggregation). The argument <code>dens_ratio</code> must also be set otherwise 
this sampling results in a curve identical to the IBR (see Details). 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>'sSBR'</code> ... spatial sample-based rarefaction in which species 
are accumulated by including spatially proximate samples first.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>'spexSBR'</code>  ... spatially-explicit sample-based rarefaction
in which species are accumulated as in <code>'sSBR'</code> but sampling
effort is not measured by no. of samples, but by cumulative distance or
cumulative area as specified by <code>'spat_algo'</code> (see details)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>effort</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional argument to specify what number of individuals, 
number of samples, or spatial sampling effort (i.e., cumulative distance
or area) depending on 'method' to compute rarefied richness as. If
not specified all possible values from 1 to the maximum sampling effort are
used</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coords</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional matrix of geographic coordinates of the samples.
Only required when using the spatial rarefaction method and this information
is not already supplied by <code>x</code>. The first column should specify 
the x-coordinate (e.g., longitude) and the second coordinate should 
specify the y-coordinate (e.g., latitude)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>latlong</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean if coordinates are latitude-longitude decimal degrees</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dens_ratio</code></td>
<td>
<p>the ratio of individual density between a reference group
and the community data (i.e., x) under consideration. This argument is
used to rescale the rarefaction curve when estimating the effect of
individual density on group differences in richness.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extrapolate</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean which specifies if richness should be extrapolated
when effort is larger than the number of individuals using the chao1 method.
Defaults to FALSE in which case it returns observed richness. Extrapolation
is only implemented for individual-based rarefaction 
(i.e., <code>method = 'indiv'</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>return_NA</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean defaults to FALSE in which the function returns the
observed S when <code>effort</code> is larger than the number of individuals or
number of samples (depending on the method of rarefaction). If set to TRUE
then NA is returned. Note that this argument is only relevant when
<code>extrapolate = FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet_mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean defaults to FALSE, if TRUE then warnings and other
non-error messages are suppressed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>spat_algo</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string that can be either: <code>'kNN'</code>,
<code>'kNCN'</code>, or <code>'convexhull'</code> for k-nearest neighbor, 
k-nearest centroid neighbor sampling, or convex-hull polygon calculation 
respectively. It defaults to k-nearest neighbor which is a 
more computationally efficient algorithm that closely approximates the 
potentially more correct k-NCN algo (see Details). Currently, <code>'kNN'</code> and
<code>'k-NCN'</code> are available for method <code>'ssBR'</code>, while <code>'kNN'</code>
<code>'convexhull'</code> are available for method <code>'spexSBR'</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sd</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean defaults to FALSE, if TRUE then standard deviation of 
richness is also returned using the formulation of Heck 1975 Eq. 2.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The analytical formulas of Cayuela et al. (2015) are used to compute
the random sampling expectation for the individual and sampled based
rarefaction methods. The spatially constrained rarefaction curve (Chiarucci
et al. 2009) also known as the sample-based accumulation curve (Gotelli and
Colwell 2001) can be computed in one of two ways which is determined by the
argument <code>spat_algo</code>. In the kNN approach each plot is accumulated by
the order of their spatial proximity to the original focal cell. If plots
have the same distance from the focal plot then one is chosen randomly to
be sampled first. In the kNCN approach, a new centroid is computed after
each plot is accumulated, then distances are recomputed from that new
centroid to all other plots and the next nearest is sampled. The kNN is
faster because the distance matrix only needs to be computed once, but the
sampling of kNCN which simultaneously minimizes spatial distance and extent
is more similar to an actual person searching a field for species. For both
kNN and kNCN, each plot in the community matrix is treated as a starting
point and then the mean of these n possible accumulation curves is
computed.
</p>
<p>For individual-based rarefaction if effort is greater than the number of
individuals and <code>extrapolate = TRUE</code> then the Chao1 method is used 
(Chao 1984, 1987). The code used to perform the extrapolation was ported
from <code>iNext::D0.hat</code> found at <a href="https://github.com/JohnsonHsieh/iNEXT">https://github.com/JohnsonHsieh/iNEXT</a>. 
T. C. Hsieh, K. H. Ma and Anne Chao are the original authors of the
<code>iNEXT</code> package. 
</p>
<p>If effort is greater than sample size and <code>extrapolate = FALSE</code> then the 
observed number of species is returned.
</p>
<p>Standard deviation of richness can only be computed for individual based rarefaction 
and it is assigned as an attribute (see examples). The code for this
computation was ported from vegan::rarefy (Oksansen et al. 2022)
