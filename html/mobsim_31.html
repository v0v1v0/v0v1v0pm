<h2>Non-spatial and spatially-explicit species sampling curves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Expected species richness as function of sample size (no. of individuals),
when individuals are sampled randomly (rarefaction) or when nearest-neighbours
are samples (accumulation).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">spec_sample_curve(comm, method = c("accumulation", "rarefaction"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Community object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Partial match to <code>accumulation</code> or <code>rarefaction</code>. Also both
methods can be included at the same time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Non-spatial sampling corresponds to the species rarefaction curve, which only
depends on the species abundance distribution and can thus be also calculated
from abundance data (see <code>rare_curve</code>).
</p>
<p>In contrast the species-accumulation curve starts from a focal individual and
only samples the nearest neighbours of the focal individual. The final
species accumulation curves is calculated as the mean over the accumulation
curves starting from all individuals.
</p>
<p>In contrast to the rarefaction curve the accumulation curve is not only
influenced by the species abundance distribution, but also by the spatial
distribution of individuals.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe with 2-3 columns. The first column indicates the sample
size (numbers of individuals), and the second and third column indicate
the expected species richness for spatial sampling (column: "spec_accum")
and/or random sampling (column "spec_rarefied")
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sim_com1 &lt;- sim_thomas_community(s_pool = 100, n_sim = 1000)
sac1 &lt;- spec_sample_curve(sim_com1, method = c("rare","acc"))

head(sac1)
plot(sac1)
