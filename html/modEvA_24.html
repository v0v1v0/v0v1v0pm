<h2>Overlap Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function analyses the range of values of the given environmental variables at the sites where a species has been recorded present.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">OA(data, sp.cols, var.cols)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame with your species' occurrence data and the predictor variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sp.cols</code></td>
<td>
<p>index number of the column containing the occurrence data of the species to be modelled. Currently only one species can be analysed at a time.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Overlap Analysis is one of the simplest forms of modelling species' distributions. It assesses the ranges of values of the given environmental variables at the sites where a species has been recorded present, and predicts where that species should be able to occur based on those presence data (e.g. Brito et al. 1999, Arntzen &amp; Teixeira 2006).
</p>
<p>OA can also be useful when extrapolating models outside their original scope (geographical area, time period or spatial resolution), as it can identify which localities are within the model's domain - i.e., within the analysed ranges of values of the variables, outside which the model may not be reliable (e.g. Barbosa et al. 2009). In this case, the response is not a species' presence, but rather the sites that have been included in the model. See also the <code>MESS</code> function for a comparison between modelled and extrapolation environments.
</p>
<p>Input data for the <code>OA</code> function are a vector or column with ones and zeros (presences vs. absences of a species if we want to model its occurrence, or modelled vs. non-modelled sites if we want to know which non-modelled sites are within the modelled range), and a matrix or data frame with the corresponding values of the environmental variables to consider (one variable in each column, values in rows).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A binary vector whith 1 where the values of all predictors lie within the ranges observed for the presence records, and 0 otherwise.
