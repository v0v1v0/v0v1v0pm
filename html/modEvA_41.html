<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If you have linear models (i.e. GLMs of family Gaussian), input data for 'varPart' are the coefficients of determination (R-squared values) of the linear regressions of the response variable on all the variables in the model, on the variables related to each particular factor, and (when there are 3 factors) on the variables related to each pair of factors. The outputs are the amounts of variance explained exclusively by each factor, the amounts explained exclusively by the overlapping effects of each pair of factors, and the amount explained by the overlap of the 3 factors if this is the case (e.g. Real et al. 2003). The amount of variation not explained by the complete model is also provided.
</p>
<p>If you have generalized linear models (GLMs) such as logistic regression (see <code>glm</code>), you have no true R-squared values; inputs can then be the squared coefficients of correlation between the model predictions given by each factor (or pair of factors) and the predictions of the complete model. Predictions can be probability (e.g. Munoz &amp; Real 2006), favourability (Baez et al. 2012, Estrada et al. 2016), or the 'logit' linear predictor (Real et al. 2013); the correltion coefficient can be e.g. Pearson's (Munoz &amp; Real 2006) or Spearman's (Baez et al. 2012). An adjusted R-squared can also be used (De Araujo et al. 2014). In GLMs, the "total variation" (AB or ABC, depending on whether you have two or three factors) is 1 (correlation of the predictions of the complete model with themselves), and output values are not the total amounts of variance (of the response variable) explained by variable groups and their overlaps, but rather their proportional contribution to the total variation explained by the model.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a data frame indicating the proportion of variance accounted for by each of the factors or groups, and (if 'plot = TRUE') a Venn diagram of the contributions of each factor or overlap. If 'return.models=TRUE', the output includes also the model obtained for each group of variables.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>These results derive from arithmetic operations between your input values, and they always sum up to 1; if your input is incorrect, the results will be incorrect as well, even if they sum up to 1.
</p>
<p>This function had a bug up to modEvA version 0.8: a badly placed line break prevented the ABC overlap from being calculated correctly. Thanks to Jurica Levatic for pointing this out and helping to solve it!
</p>
<p>Oswald van Ginkel also suggested a fix to some plotting awkwardness when using only two factors, and a nice option for colouring the plot. Many thanks!

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># if you have a linear model (LM), use (non-adjusted) R-squared values
# for each factor and for their combinations as inputs:

# with 2 factors:

varPart(A = 0.456, B = 0.315, AB = 0.852, A.name = "Spatial",
B.name = "Environmental", main = "Small whale")

varPart(A = 0.456, B = 0.315, AB = 0.852, A.name = "Spatial",
B.name = "Environmental", main = "Small whale", colr = TRUE)


# with 3 factors:

varPart(A = 0.456, B = 0.315, C = 0.281, AB = 0.051, BC = 0.444,
AC = 0.569, ABC = 0.624, A.name = "Spatial", B.name = "Human",
C.name = "Environmental", main = "Small whale")

varPart(A = 0.456, B = 0.315, C = 0.281, AB = 0.051, BC = 0.444,
AC = 0.569, ABC = 0.624, A.name = "Spatial", B.name = "Human",
C.name = "Environmental", main = "Small whale", colr = TRUE)


# if you have a generalized linear model (GLM),
# you can use squared Pearson correlation coefficients of the
# predictions of each factor with those of the complete model:

varPart(A = (-0.005)^2, B = 0.698^2, C = 0.922^2, AB = 0.696^2,
BC = 0.994^2, AC = 0.953^2, ABC = 1, A.name = "Topographic",
B.name = "Climatic", C.name = "Geographic", main = "Big bird")

# but "Unexplained variation" can be deceiving in these cases
# (see Details); try also adding 'plot.unexpl = FALSE'


# if you have a model object and a table classifying the variables into groups:

data(rotif.mods)
mod &lt;- rotif.mods$models[[2]]

head(mod$model)
vars &lt;- colnames(mod$model)[-1]
vars
var_groups &lt;- data.frame(vars = vars, groups = c("Spatial", "Spatial",
"Climate", "Climate", "Climate", "Human"))
var_groups

varPart(model = mod, groups = var_groups)
varPart(model = mod, groups = var_groups, pred.type = "P", colr = TRUE)
