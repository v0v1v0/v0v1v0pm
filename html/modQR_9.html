<h2>Getting the List of Options CTechST for <code>compContourM1/2u</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The functions <code>getCTechSTM1u</code> and <code>getCTechSTM2u</code> 
set the default list of options CTechST for computing 
all the directional (regression) quantiles by means of 
<code>compContourM1u</code> and <code>compContourM2u</code>, 
respectively.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getCTechSTM1u()
getCTechSTM2u()
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>none
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Fortunately, the default list of options usually 
leads to a satisfactory performance in all but very large 
problems.</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Both <code>getCTechSTM1u</code> and <code>getCTechSTM2u</code> produce 
a list with a few components whose default values are stated 
below after the equality sign.  
</p>
<p>The components <code>OutFilePrefS</code> and <code>getCharST</code> 
are initialized in a method-specific way.  
</p>
<p>The components <code>CubRegWiseI</code>, <code>ArchAllFI</code>, 
and <code>SkipRedI</code> are relevant only if <code>D2SpecI</code> 
is zero or if the dimension of directions/responses is 
higher than two, i.e., if the breadth-first search algorithm 
is used.  
</p>
<p>Most of the components are generated by both functions.  
Nevertheless, the component <code>SkipRedI</code> is only generated 
by <code>getCTechSTM2u</code> and used by 
<code>compContourM2u</code>.  
</p>
<p>The output components are as follows:  
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ReportI</code></td>
<td>
<p>= 0; if some information (such as the progress 
of computation) is displayed on the screen (1) 
or not (0).  
The display mode may slightly slow down the 
computation, especially when the dimension of 
responses is higher than two.  
On the other hand, it shows the new value of the 
quantile level (Tau) (if the input one has been 
changed internally), the initial L2-normed 
directional vector used (<code>U0Vec</code>), the 
number of failures to find an initial solution 
(<code>NNotFound</code>), the number of found initial 
solutions not having the right number of clearly 
nonzero coordinates (<code>NBad</code>), and also the 
width of each layer of the breadth-first search 
algorithm if it is employed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>OutSaveI</code></td>
<td>
<p>= 0; if the detailed output is stored in 
file(s) into the working directory (1) or 
not (0).  The file output seems necessary only 
for very large problems if some information 
about individual cones has to be recorded 
(such as all the regression quantile 
hyperplanes used for the regression 
quantile contour computation).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>D2SpecI</code></td>
<td>
<p>= 1; this option is relevant only for bivariate 
directions/responses and determines if the cones 
are visited counter-clockwise (1) or by means of 
the breadth-first search algorithm as in the 
general case (0).  The default option (1) leads 
to a more precise and reliable computation than 
the other.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>BriefOutputI</code></td>
<td>
<p>= 1; if the brief (1) or verbose (0) 
output is prepared by 
<code>compContourM1/2u</code>.  
Even the default option (1) is sufficient 
for almost all common applications.  
See also <code>getCharSTM1u</code> and 
<code>getCharSTM2u</code> for the 
description of the possible 
method-specific file output in both cases.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CubRegWiseI</code></td>
<td>
<p>= 1; if the directional space is divided 
into orthants investigated separately (1) 
or not (0).  
On the one hand, the default option (1) 
splits the problem into smaller ones.  
On the other hand, it also generates 
some artificial cones with at least one 
facet in the orthant borders.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ArchAllFI</code></td>
<td>
<p>= 1; if all the past cone facet 
identifiers (1) or only those from the last 
few layers (0) are stored during the computation.  
The default option (1) makes the computation 
more likely to terminate successfully than 
the other.  Unfortunately, it is also slower 
and more memory demanding.  If the dimension 
of responses is higher than three, then 
<code>ArchAllFI</code> = 1 is considered internally 
by <code>compContourM1/2u</code> no matter 
what the input <code>CTechST</code> actually says.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SkipRedI</code></td>
<td>
<p>= 0; if the information should be skipped (1) 
or stored (0) also from the cones with all 
non-artificial facets already known (such cones 
are redundant/irrelevant with probability one 
if only all the quantile regression 
hyperplanes necessary for the quantile contour 
computation are required from 
<code>compContourM2u</code>).  
The skipping makes the output smaller but 
maybe also slightly less reliable.  It also 
affects the reliability of the information 
regarding the inner points; see 
<code>compContourM2u</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>OutFilePrefS</code></td>
<td>
<p>= ‘DQOutputM1_’/‘DQOutputM2_’; 
the prefix of possible output 
file name(s).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>getCharST</code></td>
<td>
<p>= getCharSTM1u/getCharSTM2u; the function 
computing some overall characteristics that 
can be replaced with a user-defined one.  
See <code>getCharSTM1u</code> and 
<code>getCharSTM2u</code> for the default 
choices.</p>
