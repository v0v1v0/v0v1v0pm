<h2>Alzheimer's disease data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Alzheimer's disease data
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Craig-Schapiro et al. (2011) describe a clinical study of 333 patients,
including some with mild (but well-characterized) cognitive impairment as
well as healthy individuals. CSF samples were taken from all subjects. The
goal of the study was to determine if subjects in the early states of
impairment could be differentiated from cognitively healthy individuals.
Data collected on each subject included:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Demographic characteristics such as age and gender
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Apolipoprotein E genotype
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Protein measurements of Abeta, Tau, and a phosphorylated version of Tau (called pTau)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Protein measurements of 124 exploratory biomarkers, and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Clinical dementia scores
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For these analyses, we have converted the scores to two classes: impaired
and healthy. The goal of this analysis is to create classification models
using the demographic and assay data to predict which patients have early
stages of disease.
