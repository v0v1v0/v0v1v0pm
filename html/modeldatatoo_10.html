<h2>Pharmaceutical manufacturing monitoring data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Samples were collected each day from all bioreactors and glucose was
measured using both spectroscopy and the traditional manner. The goal is to
create models on the data from the more numerous small-scale bioreactors
and then evaluate if these results can accurately predict what is happening
in the large-scale bioreactors (see details below).

<h4>Experimental Background</h4>

<p>Pharmaceutical companies use spectroscopy measurements to assess critical
process parameters during the manufacturing of a biological drug. Models
built on this process can be used with real-time data to recommend changes
that can increase product yield. In the example that follows, Raman
spectroscopy was used to generate the data. These data were generated from
real data, but have been distinctly modified to preserve confidentiality and
achieve illustration purposes.
</p>
<p>To manufacture the drug being used for this example, a specific type of
protein is required and that protein can be created by a particular type of
cell. A batch of cells are seeded into a <em>bioreactor</em> which is a device that
is designed to help grow and maintain the cells. In production, a large
bioreactor would be about 2000 liters and is used to make large quantities
of proteins in about two weeks.
</p>
<p>Many factors can affect product yield. For example, because the cells are
living, working organisms, they need the right temperature and sufficient
food (glucose) to generate drug product. During the course of their work,
the cells also produce waste (ammonia). Too much of the waste product can
kill the cells and reduce the overall product yield. Typically key
attributes like glucose and ammonia are monitored daily to ensure that the
cells are in optimal production conditions. Samples are collected and
off-line measurements are made for these key attributes. If the measurements
indicate a potential problem, the manufacturing scientists overseeing the
process can tweak the contents of the bioreactor to optimize the conditions
for the cells.
</p>
<p>One issue is that conventional methods for measuring glucose and ammonia are
time consuming and the results may not come in time to address any issues.
Spectroscopy is a potentially faster method of obtaining these results
if an effective model can be used to take the results of the spectroscopy
assay to make predictions on the substances of interest (i.e., glucose and
ammonia).
</p>
<p>However, it is not feasible to do experiments using many large-scale
bioreactors. Two parallel experimental systems were used:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 15 small-scale (5 liters) bioreactors were seeded with cells and were
monitored daily for 14 days.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Three large-scale bioreactors were also seeded with cells from the same
batch and monitored daily for 14 days
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Notes on Data</h4>

<p>The intensity values have undergone signal processing up to smoothing. See
the reference for more details.
