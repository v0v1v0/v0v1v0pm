<h2>NEWWS Riverside data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS) was conducted before the nationwide welfare reform in the mid-1990s. 
Participants of the study consist of applicants to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and current AFDC recipients who were not working for 30 or more hours per week. 
They were randomly assigned to the labor force attachment (LFA) program, which aimed at moving low-income parents from welfare to work by providing employment-focused incentives and services, and the control group, which received aid from AFDC without requirement for working. 
The data is from the Riverside sample. It includes 694 participants with preschool-age children, 208 randomly assigned to the LFA program and 486 randomly assigned to the control group.
