<h2>modi: Multivariate outlier detection for incomplete survey data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package modi is a collection of functions for multivariate outlier
detection and imputation. The aim is to provide a set of functions which
cope with missing values and take sampling weights into account. The original
functions were developed in the EUREDIT project. This work was partially
supported by the EU FP5 ICT programme, the Swiss Federal Office of Education
and Science and the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Subsequent development
was in the AMELI project of the EU FP7 SSH Programme and also supported by the
University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW).
