<h2>Sample Environment Protection Expenditure Survey.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The sepe data set is a sample of the pilot survey in 1993 of the Swiss Federal Statistical
Office on environment protection expenditures of Swiss private economy in the previous
accounting year. The units are enterprises, the monetary variables are in thousand Swiss
Francs (CHF). From the original sample a random subsample was chosen of which certain
enterprises were excluded for confidentiality reasons. In addition, noise has been added
to certain variables, and certain categories have been collapsed. The data set has missing
values. The data set has first been prepared for the EU FP5 project EUREDIT and later been
data protected for educational purposes.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The sample design is stratified random sampling with different sampling rates. Use package
survey or sampling to obtain correct point and variance estimates. In addition a ratio
estimator may be built using the variable popemple which gives the total employment per
activity.
</p>
<p>There are two balance rules: the subtotals of the investment variables should
sum to totinvto and the expenditure subtotals should sum to totexpto.
</p>
<p>The missing values stem from the survey itself. In the actual survey the missing
values were declared as 'guessed' rather than copied from records.
</p>
<p>The sampling weight weight is adjusted for non-response in the stratum,
i.e. <code>weight=popsize/sampsize</code>.
