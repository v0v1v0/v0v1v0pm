<h2>Simulated temporal network data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data generated from <code>simNet</code>, with five variables that serve as
nodes in the GVAR model and a sixth that serves as a moderator. The data were
generated by setting <code>lag = 1</code> to specify a single-subject lag-1 model.
The data were simulated from a graphical vector autoregressive model (GVAR).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gvarDat
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>5000 x 6</code> data frame with five variables as nodes in a GVAR
and a sixth as a moderator. Attributes contain values for the data
generating model.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the case of using <code>simNet</code> with <code>lags = 1</code>, that function
essentially serves as a wrapper for <code>mlGVARsim</code> which
automatically sets <code>nPerson = 1</code>.
