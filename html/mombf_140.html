<h2>Hald Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Montgomery and Peck (1982) illustrated variable selection techniques on the Hald cement data and gave several references to other analysis. The response variable <em>y</em> is the <em>heat evolved</em> in a cement mix. The four explanatory variables are ingredients of the mix, i.e., x1: <em>tricalcium aluminate</em>, x2: <em>tricalcium silicate</em>, x3: <em>tetracalcium alumino ferrite</em>, x4: <em>dicalcium silicate</em>. An important feature of these data is that the variables x1 and x3 are highly correlated (corr(x1,x3)=-0.824), as well as the variables x2 and x4 (with corr(x2,x4)=-0.975). Thus we should expect any subset of (x1,x2,x3,x4) that includes one variable from highly correlated pair to do as any subset that also includes the other member.
