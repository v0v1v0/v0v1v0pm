<h2>momentchi2: A package containing a collection of moment-matching methods for computing the cdf of a weighted sum of chi-squared random variables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>momentchi2</code> package provides implementations of moment-matching (equivalently, cumulant-matching)
methods for computing the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a positively-weighted sum of chi-squared random variables.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Methods implemented include the Satterthwaite-Welch (SW), Hall-Buckley-Eagleson (HBE), Wood F (WF) and
Lindsay-Pilla-Basak (LPB4) methods. Note that the chi-squared random variables are assumed to have degree 1.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>Those interested in weighted sums of chi-squared random variables are encouraged to also have a look at the excellent <code>CompQuadForm</code> R package, which provides implementations of several iterative methods for computing the cdf of a weighted sum of (potentially noncentral) chi-squared random variables.
