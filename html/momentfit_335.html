<h2> ~~ Methods for Function <code>ThreeSLS</code> in Package <span class="pkg">momentfit</span> ~~</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Method to estimate system of equations by Three-Stage least squares
(3SLS) or, as a special case, by Seemingly Unrelatd Regressions (SUR).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S4 method for signature 'slinearModel'
ThreeSLS(model, coefOnly=FALSE, qrZ=NULL,
Sigma=NULL)
## S4 method for signature 'rslinearModel'
ThreeSLS(model, coefOnly=FALSE, qrZ=NULL,
Sigma=NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>"slinearModel"</code> in which
instruments are the same in each equation and the error terms are
homoscedastic.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coefOnly</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the method return the only the coefficients or
create an object of class <code>"sgmmfit"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>qrZ</code></td>
<td>
<p>The qr decomposition of the common instruments. It is
mostly used by <code>gmmFit</code> to avoid recomputing it in
iterative GMM or CUE. It should not be used directly unless the user
knows what he is doing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Sigma</code></td>
<td>
<p>The covariance matrix of the residuals. If not provided,
it is computed using the residuals of the equation by equation
two-stage least squares. It should not be used directly unless the
user knows what he is doing.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Methods</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>signature(model = "slinearModel")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The method is specifically for system of linear models with the same
instruments and homoscedastic errors. It becomes SUR as a special case
when the instruments are the union of all regressors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(model = "rslinearModel")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This method is for restricted models that does not impose cross-equation
restrictions. With such restrictions 3SLS is not possible as we can
no longer write the model as a system of equations.
