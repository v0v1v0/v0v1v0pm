<h2>Subsetting methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Different subsetting methods for S4 class objects of the package. The
subset method returns an new object with observations selected by the
second argument. See example.
</p>


<h3>Methods</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>signature(x = "momentWeights", i = "integer", j = "missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It creates a partition from the weighting matrix. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "momentWeights", i = "missing", j = "missing")</code></dt>
<dd>  
<p>It generates the whole weighting matrix. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "sysMomentWeights", i = "missing", j = "list")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It creates a partition from the weighting matrix. j has no effect
here.  It creates a partition from the weighting matrix in a systemof  
equations. i selects the equation and the list j the moments in each
equation. Missing i means all equations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "sysMomentWeights", i = "numeric", j =
    "missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It creates a partition from the weighting matrix. j has no effect
here.  It creates a partition from the weighting matrix in a systemof  
equations. i selects the equation and the list j the moments in each
equation. Missing j means all moments.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "sysMomentWeights", i = "missing", j = "missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>No effect. It returns x.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "snonlinearModel", i = "numeric", j="missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It generates a system of equations with a subset of equations selected
by i. If the number of remaining equations is one, it returns an
object of class <code>"nonlinearGmm"</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "slinearModel", i = "numeric", j="missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It generates a system of equations with a subset of equations selected
by i. If the number of remaining equations is one, it returns an
object of class <code>"linearModel"</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "rslinearModel", i = "numeric", j="missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It is only use to select one equation when no cross-equation
restrictions are imposed. Only one equation can be selected. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "rsnonlinearModel", i = "numeric", j="missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It is only use to select one equation when no cross-equation
restrictions are imposed. Only one equation can be selected. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "sysMomentModel", i = "numeric", j="list")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It generates a system of equations with a subset of equations selected
by i and a subset of moment conditions selected by j. If the number of
remaining equations is one, it returns an object of class <code>"linearGmm"</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "sysMomentModel", i = "missing", j="missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>No effect. It returns x.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "momentModel", i = "missing", j = "missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns the model without any change.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "functionModel", i = "numeric", j = "missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It generates the same model with a subset of the moment conditions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "formulaModel", i = "numeric", j = "missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It generates the same model with a subset of the moment conditions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>signature(x = "rfuncionModel", i = "numeric", j = "missing")</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>It generates the same model with a subset of the moment conditions. j
has no effect here.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(simData)
model1 &lt;- momentModel(y~x1+x2, ~x2+x3+z1+z2+z3, data=simData, vcov="MDS")
w &lt;- evalWeights(model1, theta=1:3)
w[]
w[1:3]

## A model with a subset of the instruments
model1[1:4]

## Selecting the observations:

subset(model1, simData[["x1"]]&lt;3)
subset(model1, 1:25)

</code></pre>
