<h2>Class <code>"detectionList"</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These objects contain information on template detections, as well as (almost) all the information contained in <code>templateScores</code> 
These objects represent the final result of the template detection process.
Various functions exist for working with these objects.
Information on the detections alone can be extracted with <code>getDetections</code>.

</p>


<h3>Objects from the Class</h3>

<p>Objects can be created by calls of the form <code>new("detectionList", ...)</code>.
However, these objects should always be created by applying the <code>findPeaks</code> to <code>templateScores</code> objects.
There are other functions the exist for modifying existing <code>detectionList</code> objects, including <code>showPeaks</code>, and the combination of <code>templateCutoff</code> and <code>findDetections</code>.

<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt>
<code>survey.name</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>"character"</code>. The name of the survey file, or <code>"A Wave object"</code> if the survey was not read in from a file.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>survey</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>Wave</code>. The survey data, as a <code>"Wave"</code> object.</p>
</dd> 
<dt>
<code>survey.data</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>list</code>. A named list, with one element for each template. Each element contains data from a Fourier transform of the original survey: <code>amp</code> is a matrix of amplitudes (frequency by time, r by column), <code>t.bins</code> is a numeric vector with the values of the time bins (left-aligned–first bin is always 0.0), and <code>frq.bins</code> is a numeric vector with the values of the frequency bins (top-aligned–last bin is always the upper limit). There is a separate element for each template because each template may use different parameters for the Fourier transform (see <code>Template</code>).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>templates</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>list</code>. A named list of templates, which is identical to the original <code>TemplateList</code> used for template matching. This template list can be extracted with <code>getTemplates</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>scores</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>list</code>. A named list, with one element for each template. Each element is a data frame with three columns: <code>date.time</code> is the absolute time of the score, <code>time</code> is the relative time of the score (relative to the survey start), and <code>score</code> is the score. Times are based on the center of the template, and so <code>time</code> will not correspond to values in <code>t.bins</code> in the <code>survey.data</code> above if the template spans an even number of time bins.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>peaks</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>list</code>. A named list, with one element for each template. Each element is a data frame that contains information on peaks that were found. The first three columns are identical to those in the <code>scores</code> data frames (above) (but of course only contain those values that were identified as peaks). The fourth column is logical and indicates whether the peak was also a detection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>detections</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Object of class <code>list</code>. A named list, with one element for each template. Each element is a data frame that contains information on detections. The columns are identical to those in the <code>scores</code> data frames (above) (but of course only contain those values that were identified as detections (i.e., peaks with a score above the <code>score.cutoff</code>).</p>
