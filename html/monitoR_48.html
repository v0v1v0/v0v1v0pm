<h2>Automated Acoustic Monitoring–overview and examples</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>monitoR contains functions for template matching, template construction, spectrogram viewing and annotation, and direct MySQL database connectivity.  This package offers two fully-supported template matching algorithms: binary point matching and spectrogram cross-correlation.  The direct database connection facilitates efficient data management when batch processing as well as template storage and sharing.  It supplies a database schema that is useful for managing recorders in the field as well as functions for reading metadata from sound files when they are copied from external media.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For an introduction to the package see the vignette. For some introductory examples, see ‘Examples’ below.

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>A Fourier transformed is used in the <span class="pkg">monitoR</span> package to transform time-domain acoustic data to frequency-domain data (i.e., the data displayed in the spectrograms used to produce templates). The <code>spectro</code> function used in our package is a pared-down version of a function of the same name in Jerome Sueur's excellent package <span class="pkg">seewave</span>. To use <code>spectro</code>, the <span class="pkg">seewave</span> functions <code>dBweight</code>, <code>ftwindow</code>, <code>hamming.w</code> and other window functions, and <code>stft</code> are from <span class="pkg">seewave</span>. The function <code>readMP3</code> is modified from Uwe Ligges' package <span class="pkg">tuneR</span>. And several other <span class="pkg">tuneR</span> functions are used directly from the <span class="pkg">tuneR</span> package. Without <span class="pkg">seewave</span> and <span class="pkg">tuneR</span> this project would have gotten off to a much slower start.   
</p>
<p>Generous funding for this work was provided by the National Park Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Phenology Network.

<h3>Functions in monitoR</h3>

<p>Create a MySQL database (<code>dbSchema</code>), to which survey metadata, templates and metadata, and results can be sent. Copy sound files from external media (<code>fileCopyRename</code>) and upload the metadata to the database (<code>dbUploadSurvey</code>).  View and interactively annotate sound files of any length (<code>viewSpec</code>). Download a table of surveys from the database (<code>dbDownloadSurvey</code>), construct a template (<code>makeBinTemplate</code> or <code>makeCorTemplate</code>), detect/score events in a survey (<code>binMatch</code>, <code>corMatch</code>), apply a threshold to the scores (<code>findPeaks</code>), send the results to the database (<code>dbUploadResult</code>).
