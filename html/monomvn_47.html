<h2>Financial Returns data from NYSE and AMEX</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Monthly returns of common domestic stocks traded on the NYSE and the
AMEX from April 1968 until 1998; also contains the return to the market
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(returns)
data(returns.test)
data(market)
data(market.test)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The returns provided are collected in a <code>data.frame</code> with
1168 columns, and 360 rows in the case of <code>returns</code> and 12
rows for <code>returns.test</code>. The columns are uniquely coded to
identify the stock traded on NYSE or AMEX.  The market return
is in two vectors <code>market</code> and <code>market.test</code>
of length 360 and 12, respectively
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The columns contain monthly returns of common domestic stocks traded
on the NYSE and the AMEX from April 1968 until 1998. <code>returns</code>
contains returns up until 1997, whereas <code>returns.test</code> has the
returns for 1997.  Both data sets have been cleaned in the following
way.  All stocks have a share price greater than $5 and a market
capitalization greater than 20% based on the size distribution of
NYSE firms.  Stocks without completely observed return
series in 1997 were also discarded.
</p>
<p>The market returns provided are essentially the monthly return on the
S&amp;P500 during the same period, which is highly correlated with the
raw monthly returns weighted by their market capitalization
</p>

<p>This data is a subset of that originally used by Chan, Karceski,
and Lakonishok (1999), and subsequently by several others;
see the references below.  We use it as part of the <span class="pkg">monomvn</span>
package as an example of a real world data set following a
nearly monotone missingness pattern
