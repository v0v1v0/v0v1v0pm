<h2>Robert Boyle's pressure vs volume measurements</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Pressure versus volume of air at a constant temperature as collected by Robert Boyle. Units are arbitrary.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Boyle
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 7 rows and numerical variables <code>pressure</code> and <code>volume</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Robert Boyle (1627-1691) was a founder of modern chemistry
and the scientific method in general. As any chemistry student already knows,
Boyle sought to understand the properties of gasses.
His results are summarized in <em>Boyle's Law</em>.
The data frame <code>Boyle</code> contains two variables from one of Boyle's
experiments as reported in his lab notebook: pressure in a bag of
air and volume of the bag. The units of pressure are mmHg and the units of
volume are cubic inches.
