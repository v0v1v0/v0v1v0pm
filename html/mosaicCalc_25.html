<h2>Characteristics of computer central processing unit chips over the decades</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Since single-chip central processing units were introduced in the early 1970s,
performance has increased exponentially. Around 1965, Gorden E. Moore, a co-founder
of the integrated circuit giant Intel, postulated that capacity of chips, measured as
the number of transistors, doubles approximately every two years. Known as Moore's Law, this
pattern has held true for decades.
