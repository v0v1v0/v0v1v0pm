<h2>Case numbers in an Ebola outbreak in 2014</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In December 2013, an 18-month-old boy from a village in Guinea suffered fatal diarrhea.  Over the next months a broader outbreak was discovered, and in mid-March 2014, the Pasteur Institute in France confirmed the illness as Ebola-Virus Disease caused by the Zaire ebolavirus.
Although the outbreak was first recognized in Guinea,
it eventually encompassed Liberia and Sierra Leone
as well.  By July 2014, the outbreak spread to the
capitals of all three countries.

<p>A dataframe with 182 rows. Each row is a daily report
