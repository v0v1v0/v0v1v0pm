<h2>Trajectory of a fly ball in baseball</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The trajectory of a fly ball as calculated by a sophisticated
model involving drag, spin, and such. The physics and mathematics are described
at <a href="http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/TrajectoryAnalysis.pdf">http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/TrajectoryAnalysis.pdf</a>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Fly_ball
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 552 rows.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>t</code> - (seconds). Runs from 0 to 5.51 s
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>y</code> - horizontal position (feet)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>z</code> - vertical position (feet)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The ball has a mass of 5.125 ounces and a circumference of 9.125 inches
The speed off the bat was 103 mph at a launch angle of 27.5 degrees from
the horizontal. The ball was hit with backspin at 2500 rpm by a right-handed
batter. Ambient temperature 70 deg F with a relative humidity of 50% and a
barometric pressure of 29.92 inHg. The field was at an elevation of 15 feet.
</p>
<p>The position of the ball was recorded every 0.01 seconds, for 5.5 seconds altogether.
If you prefer to work with continuous functions of time, you
can construct them. See the examples.
