<h2>Countries</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame containing country names as used by Gapminder and the <code>maps</code>
package to facilitate conversation between the two.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Countries)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 258 observations on the following variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>maptools</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>region name http://mappinghacks.com/ data sets</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gapminder</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>country name in Gapminder data sets</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>maps</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>region name in <code>maps</code> data sets</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The "countries" in the <code>maps</code> data include several other geographic regions (bodies
of water, islands belonging to other countries, Hawaii, etc.) that are not countries.
Furthermore, the <code>maps</code> countries do not include many of the countries that
have been created since ca. 2000.  The mapping is therefore many-to-many, and also
includes some NAs when there is no appropriate mapping.  Bodies of water in the
<code>maps</code> data, for example, are not assigned a country in the Gapminder.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Countries)
subset(Countries, maps=="Yugoslavia")  # Where has Yugoslavia gone?
subset(Countries, is.na(gapminder))    # Things from maps with no Gapminder equivalent
subset(Countries, is.na(maps))         # Things from Gapminder with no maps equivalent
</code></pre>
