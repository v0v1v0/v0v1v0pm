<h2>Create bootstrapped ensembles of a model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create bootstrapped ensembles of a model
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mod_ensemble(model, nreps = 2, data = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>a model whose data will be used for resampling</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nreps</code></td>
<td>
<p>how many resampling trials should be created</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data table to use for resampling. This is not needed for many common
model types, such as <code>lm</code>, <code>glm</code>, etc. See details.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The approach to bootstrapping implemented by this function is to create a set of bootstrap
trials all in one go. Then, other functions such as <code>mod_effect()</code> and <code>mod_eval()</code> will be
used to extract the information from each of the bootstrap replicates. Many model types in R carry the
data used to train the model as part of the model object produced. For these types of models, e.g. <code>lm</code> and
<code>glm</code>, there is no need to provide a value for the <code>data</code> argument. But there are some
types of models for which the training data cannot be extracted from the model object. In such situations,
you use <code>data =</code> to provide the data set to use for resampling.
