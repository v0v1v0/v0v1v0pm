<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are about 10,000 participants each year, of whom roughly half have run the race previously. During the
ten years of these records, some 25 runners ran in ech of the years, 73 ran in nine of the years, and so on.
The data allow you to track the performace of runners as they age. This simplified version of the data does
not include personal identifying data other than sex, age, and number of previous runs in any given year. (Runs
before 1999 are not considered.)
