<h2>Swimming speed of tadpoles.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tim Watkins examined the swimming speed of tadpoles as a function of the water temperature, and the
water temperature at which the tadpoles had been raised. Since size is a major determinant of speed,
the tadpole's length was measured as well.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Tadpoles)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame <code>Trucking_jobs</code> with 129 rows and 11 variables.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>group</code> Whether the tadpole was raised in cold water ("c") or warm ("w").
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rtemp</code> The temperature (C) of the water in which the swimming speed was measured. (The swimming channel is called a "race".)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>length</code> The tadpole's length, in mm.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>vmax</code> The maximum swimming speed attained in one trial, in mm/sec.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It was hypothesized that tadpoles would swim faster in the temperature of water close to that in which they had been raised.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mod_1 = lm(vmax ~ poly(rtemp, 2) * group + length, data = Tadpoles)
</code></pre>
