<h2>Birth weights and maternal data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Birth weight, date, and gestational period collected as part
of the Child Health and Development Studies in 1961 and 1962.
Information about the baby's parents â€” age, education, height,
weight, and whether the mother smoked is also recorded.
The data were present by Nolan and Speed to address the question
of whether there is a link between maternal smoking and the
baby's health.
