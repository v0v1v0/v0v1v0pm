<h2>Grades at a small college</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are the actual grades for 400+ individual students in the courses they took
at a small, liberal-arts college in the midwest US. All the students graduated in 2006.
Each row corresponds to a single student in a single course. The data have been de-identified by translating the student ID, the instructor
ID, and the name of the department. Typically a graduating student has taken about 32 courses.
As another form of de-identification, only half of the courses each student, selected randomly,
are included. Only courses with 10 or more students enrolled were included.
</p>
