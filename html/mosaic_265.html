<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In an experiment on memory (Mednicj et al, 2008), students were given lists
of 24 words to memorize.  After hearing the words they were assigned at
random to different groups. One group of 12 students took a nap for 1.5 hours
while a second group of 12 students stayed awake and was given a caffeine
pill.  The data set records the number of words each participant was
able to recall after the break.
