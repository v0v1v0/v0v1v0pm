<h2>Calculates quality metrics of clustering or segmentation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates three metrics to evaluate quality of spatial patterns' clustering or segmentation.
When the type is <code>"cluster"</code>, then metrics of inhomogeneity, distinction, and quality are calculated.
When the type is <code>"segmentation"</code>, then metrics of inhomogeneity, isolation, and quality are calculated.
For more information, see Details below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lsp_add_quality(x, x_dist, type = "cluster", regions = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For type <code>"cluster"</code>, this function calculates three quality metrics to evaluate spatial patterns' clustering:
(1) inhomogeneity - it measures a degree of mutual dissimilarity
between all objects in a cluster. This value is between 0 and 1,
where small value indicates that all objects in the cluster
represent consistent patterns so the cluster is pattern-homogeneous.
(2) distinction - it is an average distance between the focus cluster
and all of the other clusters.
This value is between 0 and 1, where large value indicates that the cluster
stands out from the other clusters.
(3) quality - overall quality of a cluster. It is calculated as
1 - (inhomogeneity / distinction). This value is also between 0 and 1,
where increased values indicate increased quality.

<p>For type <code>"segmentation"</code>, this function calculates three quality metrics to evaluate spatial patterns' segmentation:
(1) inhomogeneity - it measures a degree of mutual dissimilarity
between all objects in a cluster. This value is between 0 and 1,
where small value indicates that all objects in the cluster
represent consistent patterns so the cluster is pattern-homogeneous.
(2) isolation - it is an average distance between the focus cluster
and all of its neighbors. This value is between 0 and 1,
where large value indicates that the cluster
stands out from its surroundings.
(3) quality - overall quality of a cluster. It is calculated as
1 - (inhomogeneity / distinction). This value is also between 0 and 1,
where increased values indicate increased quality.
