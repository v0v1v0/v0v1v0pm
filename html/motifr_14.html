between actors and activities indicate that an actor is active in a given
activity. Links between activities indicate that the activities are
causally interdependent. The network contains two variables to describe
nodes/ vertices. </p>

<dd>
<p>Binary variable specifying network levels for every node (1
= node is a social node (actor) , 0 = node is a non-social node (an
activity))</p>
