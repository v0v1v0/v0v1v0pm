<h2>A mousetrap data object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data object of class "mousetrap" with example data created by importing
mt_example_raw and applying basic post-processing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mt_example
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A mousetrap data object is a list containing  at least the
following objects:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>data</code>: a data.frame containing the trial data (from
which the mouse-tracking data columns have been removed). More
information about the content of the trial data in <code>mt_example</code> can
be found in mt_example_raw. The rownames of <code>data</code>
correspond to the trial identifier. For convenience, the trial identifier
is also stored in an additional column called "mt_id".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>trajectories</code>: an array containing the raw
mouse-tracking trajectories. The first dimension represents the different
trials and the dimension names (which can be accessed using
rownames) correspond to the trial identifier (the same identifier
that is used as the <code>rownames</code> in <code>data</code>). The second dimension
corresponds to the samples taken over time which are included in
chronological order. The third dimension corresponds to the different
mouse-tracking variables (timestamps, x-positions, y-positions) which are
usually called <code>timestamps</code>, <code>xpos</code>, and <code>ypos</code>. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some functions in this package (e.g., mt_time_normalize and
mt_average) add additional trajectory arrays (e.g.,
<code>tn_trajectories</code> and <code>av_trajectories</code>) to the mousetrap data
object. Other functions modify the existing arrays (e.g.,
mt_derivatives adds distance, velocity, and acceleration
to an existing dataset). Finally mt_measures adds an
additional data.frame with mouse-tracking measures to it.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The raw data set was imported using mt_import_mousetrap. Trajectories
were then remapped using mt_remap_symmetric so that all trajectories
end in the top-left corner and their starting point was aligned using
mt_align_start to a common value (0,0).
