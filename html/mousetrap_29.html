<h2>Raw mouse-tracking dataset for demonstrations of the mousetrap package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An exemplary mouse-tracking dataset collected
<a href="https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/">OpenSesame</a> using the
<a href="https://github.com/pascalkieslich/mousetrap-os">mousetrap plugin</a>
(Kieslich &amp; Henninger, 2017). A preprocessed (as opposed to raw) version of
the same data can be found in mt_example.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mt_example_raw
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data.frame with 38 rows and 19 variables. The data.frame is
based on the combined raw data that were created using
read_opensesame from the
<a href="http://pascalkieslich.github.io/readbulk/">readbulk</a> library. For
ease of use, unnecessary columns were excluded.
</p>
<p>The variables included relate to the item that was presented
(<code>Exemplar</code>), the answer categories (<code>Category1</code> and
<code>Category2</code>), the subject identifier (<code>subject_nr</code>) the subjects'
response (<code>response_get_response</code>), as well as the mouse-tracking
variables (<code>timestamps_get_response</code>, <code>xpos_get_response</code> and
<code>ypos_get_response</code>). Besides, a number of additional variables are
included, e.g., some variables relating to the general settings of the
experiment (e.g., the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the screen in
pixels).
</p>
<p>Each mouse-tracking variable contains a list of values (separated by ', ')
</p>

<ul><li>
<p> one entry for each recorded position of the mouse. The position
coordinates are given in pixels, such that values of zero for both
<code>xpos_get_response</code> and <code>ypos_get_response</code> indicate that the
cursor is located in the center of the screen. Both variables increase in
value as the mouse moves toward the bottom right. Timestamps are given in
milliseconds.
</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data stem from a study based on experiment 1 by Dale et al. (2007). In
this experiment, participants have to assign exemplars (e.g., "shark") to one
of two categories (e.g., "fish" or "mammal") by clicking on the button
corresponding to the correct category. All exemplars and categories were
translated to and presented in German.
</p>
<p>Across the 19 trials of the experiment, participants categorized 13 exemplars
that were typical of their category and 6 atypical exemplars for which this
was not the case. For the atypical exemplars (e.g., "whale"), the competing
category ("fish") was selected to compete with the correct category
("mammal"). The hypothesis under investigation is whether participants' mouse
trajectories deviate more towards the competing category for the atypical
exemplars, indicating increased conflict between the response options.
</p>
<p>Please note that <code>mt_example_raw</code> should only be used for exploring the
features of the mousetrap package and not for any substantive analysis.
