<h2>Corridor behavior identification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function identifies movement track segments whose attributes suggest corridor use behavior</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  ## S4 method for signature '.MoveTrackSingle'
corridor(x,speedProp=.75, circProp=.25, minNBsegments = 2, plot=FALSE, ...)
  ## S4 method for signature '.MoveTrackStack'
corridor(x,speedProp=.75, circProp=.25, minNBsegments = 2, plot=FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>move</code>, <code>moveStack</code> or <code>moveBurst</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>speedProp</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric between 0 and 1, defines the proportion of speeds which are high enough to be a valid corridor point (default value selects speeds that are greater than 75 % of all speeds).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>circProp</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric between 0 and 1, defines the proportion of the circular variances that is low enough to be a valid corridor point. Low values of the circular variance indicate that the segments are (near) parallel (default value selects variances that are lower than 25 % of all variances).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minNBsegments</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric equal or larger than 2 representing the minimum number of neiburing corridor segments that each corridor segments has to have (see Details). Default is 2.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical, if TRUE the track is plotted together with dots that indicate corridor points when a <code>move</code> object is provided (color scale indicates how many corridor points are near by, few: blue, many: pink).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The corridor function uses the attributes of a movement step (segment) to identify movement steps that exhibit corridor use behavior. For each segment, the speed and the azimuth are calculated and assigned to the segment midpoint. <br>
A circular buffer is created around the midpoint of each segment whose radius is equal to half the segment length. The segment azimuth (180 &gt;= azimuth &gt; -180) is converted into a new unit, the 'pseudo-azimuth' (0 &lt;= 360), removing the directional information. <br>
Subsequent, the circular variance of the pseudo-azimuths of all segment midpoints that fall within the circular buffer is calculated. Low values of the circular variance indicate that the segments are (near) parallel. <br>
Next, it is determined whether a segment's speed is higher than <code>speedProp</code> (by default the upper 25% speeds) and its circular variance is lower than <code>circProp</code> (by default the lower 25% of all variances). <br>
Segment midpoints that meet both of these requirements are considered as a 'corridor' point, all others are considered 'non-corridor' points. Finally, a corridor point is determined to be within a true corridor if within its circular buffer there are more 'corridor' points than 'non-corridor' points.
The argument <code>minNBsegments</code> can be used to establish the minimum number of 'corridor' points that each circular buffer needs for the focal segment to be defined as a corridor. It is useful to exclude wrongly (visual inspection) identified corridors with only a few segments by increasing the value of <code>minNBsegments</code>. Note that when increasing the value of <code>minNBsegments</code>, only segments with enough corridor neighbors are classified as corridors and not all segments that visually seem to fit to be classified as corridors. To remove the wrongly classified corridors, a value of 3 or 4 is usually sufficient.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a <code>moveBurst</code> object or a list of moveBurst objects (if a MoveStack is supplied). The MoveBurst date.frame stores the following information: <br>
- segment midpoint <br>
- speed <br>
- azimuth <br>
- pseudo-azimuth <br>
- circular variance <br><br> 
The object is bursted by the factor that indicates whether the segment belongs to a corridor segment or not, and is specified in the "burstId" slot. 
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The default values for the <code>speedProp</code> and <code>circProp</code> can be changed by the users discretion using the according argument.
