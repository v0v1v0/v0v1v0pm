<h2>Generate random Lefkovitch matrix population models (MPMs) based on life
history archetypes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is deprecated. Use <code>rand_lefko_mpm</code> instead.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">random_mpm(n_stages, fecundity, archetype = 1, split = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_stages</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer defining the number of stages for the MPM.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fecundity</code></td>
<td>
<p>Fecundity is the average number of offspring produced.
Values can be provided in 4 ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> An numeric vector of length 1 to provide a fecundity measure to the top
right corner of the matrix model only.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A numeric vector of integers of length equal to <code>n_stages</code> to provide
fecundity estimates for the whole top row of the matrix model. Use 0 for
cases with no reproduction.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A matrix of numeric values of the same dimension as <code>n_stages</code> to
provide fecundity estimates for the entire matrix model. Use 0 for cases
with no reproduction.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A list of two matrices of numeric values, both with the same dimension
as <code>n_stages</code>, to provide lower and upper estimates of mean fecundity for
the entire matrix model.
In the latter case, a fecundity value will be drawn from a uniform
distribution for the defined range. If there is no reproduction in a
particular age class, use a value of 0 for both the lower and upper limit.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>archetype</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indication of which life history archetype should be used,
based on Takada et al. 2018. An integer between 1 and 4.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>split</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE/FALSE, indicating whether the matrix produced should be
split into a survival matrix and a fertility matrix. Yeah true, then the
output becomes a list with a matrix in each element. Otherwise, the output
is a single matrix.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Generates a random matrix population model (MPM) with element values based on
defined life history archetypes. Survival and transition/growth probabilities
from any particular stage are restricted to be less than or equal to 1 by
drawing from a Dirichlet distribution. The user can specify archetypes (from
Takada et al. 2018) to restrict the MPMs in other ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Archetype 1: all elements are positive, although they may be very small.
Therefore, transition from/to any stage is possible. This model describes a
life history where individuals can progress and retrogress rapidly.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Archetype 2: has the same form as archetype 1 (transition from/to any stage
is possible), but the survival probability (column sums of the survival
matrix) increases monotonously as the individuals advance to later stages.
This model, as the one in the first archetype, also allows for rapid
progression and retrogression, but is more realistic in that stage-specific
survival probability increases with stage advancement.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Archetype 3: positive non-zero elements for survival are only allowed on
the diagonal and lower sub-diagonal of the matrix This model represents the
life cycle of a species where retrogression is not allowed, and progression
can only happen to the immediately larger/more developed stage (slow
progression, e.g., trees).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Archetype 4: This archetype has the same general form as archetype 3, but
with the further assumption that stage-specific survival increases as
individuals increase in size/developmental stage. In this respect it is
similar to archetype 2.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all 4 of these Archetypes, fecundity is placed as a single element on the
top right of the matrix, if it is a single value. If it is a vector of length
<code>n_stages</code> then the fertility vector spans the entire top row of the matrix.
</p>
<p>The function is constrained to only output ergodic matrices.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a random matrix population model with characteristics
determined by the archetype selected and fecundity vector. If split = TRUE,
the matrix is split into separate fertility and a growth/survival matrices,
returned as a list.
