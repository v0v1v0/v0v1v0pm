<h2>Load and Prepare the input data with experimental design file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Based on submitted experimental design file the input data will be imported, renamed and default filtering will be applied. An experimental design template is available with write_experimental_design.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">load_experimental_design(path)
</code></pre>
