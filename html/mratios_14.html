<h2> Mutagenicity assay </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Mutagenicity assay for 4 doses of a compound (hydroquinone) against a negative (vehicle) control and a positive (active) control (cyclophosphamide). 
Hydroquinone was applied in doses of 30, 50, 70, 100 mg/kg, positive control was applied with 25mg/kg.
Counts of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes after 24h are taken as a measure for the potency to induce chromosome damage. Data of male mice are presented
(Hauschke et al., 2005).

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 31 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Treatment</dt>
