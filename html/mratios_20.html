<h2> Body weight of rats in a toxicity study </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Body weights of male rats were compared between a control group and a group which had received a high dose of a chemical in a toxicity study after a period of recovery
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(rat.weight)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 20 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with two levels, Dosis and Kon, where Dosis is the high dose group, consisiting of ten individulas and Kon is the control group, consisting of ten individuals</p>
</dd>
<dt>weight</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector containing the values of response variable, final body weight in gramm</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Aim was to test that application of the chemical does not lead to a relevantly lowered or heightened body weight after a time of recovery. 0.8 and 1.25 were defined as relevance boundaries compared to the mean of control group </p>
