<h2>Set up a data storage locker</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A locker is a directory structure where an enclosing folder contains
subfolders that in turn contain the results of different simulation runs.
When the number of simulation result sets is known, a stream of file names
is returned. This function is mainly called by other functions; an exported
function and documentation is provided in order to better communicate how
the locker works.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">setup_locker(where, tag = locker_tag(where))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>where</code></td>
<td>
<p>The directory that contains tagged directories of run
results.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tag</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of a folder under <code>where</code>; this directory must not
exist the first time the locker is set up and <strong>will be deleted</strong> and
re-created each time it is used to store output from a new simulation run.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>where</code> must exist when setting up the locker. The directory <code>tag</code> will be
created under <code>where</code> and must not exist except if it had previously been
set up using <code>setup_locker</code>. Existing <code>tag</code> directories will have a
hidden file in them indicating that they are established simulation output
folders.
</p>
<p>When recreating the <code>tag</code> directory, it will be unlinked and created new.
To not try to set up a locker directory that already contains outputs that
need to be preserved. You can call <code>noreset_locker()</code> on that directory
to prevent future resets.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The locker location.
