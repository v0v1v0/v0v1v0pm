<h2>About the lsoda differential equation solver used by mrgsolve</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The differential equation solver is a C++ translation of DLSODA from
ODEPACK.  The C++ translation was created by Dilawar Singh and hosted
here <a href="https://github.com/dilawar/libsoda-cxx/">https://github.com/dilawar/libsoda-cxx/</a>.
As we understand the history of the code, Heng Li was also involved in early
versions of the code written in C.  There was a potentially-related
project hosted here <a href="https://github.com/sdwfrost/liblsoda/">https://github.com/sdwfrost/liblsoda/</a>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The C++ translation by Dilawar Singh contains functions that appear to be
based on BLAS and LAPACK routines.  These functions have been renamed to be
distinct from the respective BLAS and LAPACK function names.  References
are given in the section below.

<h3>History</h3>

<p>The following history was recorded in the source code published by
Dilawar Singh:

/*
* HISTORY:
* This is a CPP version of the LSODA library for integration into MOOSE
somulator.
* The original was aquired from
* http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/SOURCES/C/kinetics2/index.shtml and modified
by
* Heng Li &lt;lh3lh3@gmail.com&gt;. Heng merged several C files into one and added a
* simpler interface. [Available
here](http://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/download/lsoda.c)

* The original source code came with no license or copyright
* information. Heng Li released his modification under the MIT/X11 license. I
* maintain the same license. I have removed quite a lot of text/comments from
* this library. Please refer to the standard documentation.
