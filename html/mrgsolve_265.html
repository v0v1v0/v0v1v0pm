<h2>Request simulated output</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Use this function to select, by name, either compartments or derived 
variables that have been captured (see <code>CAPTURE</code>) into
the simulated output.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Req(x, ...)

req(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'mrgmod'
req(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>model object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>unquoted names of compartments or tabled items</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There is also a <code>Req</code> argument to <code>mrgsim</code> that can 
be set to accomplish the same thing as a call to <code>Req</code> in 
the pipeline.
</p>
<p>Note the difference between <code>req</code> and <code>Req</code>: the former only 
selects compartments to appear in output while the latter selects both 
compartments and captured items.  Also, when there are items are explicitly
listed in <code>Req</code>, all other compartments or captured items not listed
there are ignored.  But when compartments are selected with <code>req</code>
all of the captured items are returned.  Remember that <code>req</code> is 
strictly for compartments.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mod &lt;- mrgsolve::house()

mod %&gt;% Req(CP,RESP) %&gt;% ev(amt=1000) %&gt;%  mrgsim

</code></pre>
