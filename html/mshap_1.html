<h2>mSHAP</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function for calculation SHAP values of two-part models.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mshap(shap_1, shap_2, ex_1, ex_2, shap_1_names = NULL, shap_2_names = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shap_1, shap_2</code></td>
<td>
<p>The SHAP values that will be multiplied together.  They
may be matrices or data frames, and up to one may be a list where each
element is a matrix or data frame (this is necessary when one of the
models is a multinomial classifier, for instance).  Each data frame or
matrix here must have the same number of rows, and if there are different
numbers of columns or the columns are not the same, then <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠shap_*_names⁠</code>
must be specified.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ex_1, ex_2</code></td>
<td>
<p>The expected values of the models across the training set.
If one of the arguments <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠shap_*⁠</code> is a list, then the corresponding <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠ex_*⁠</code>
argument must be a vector (or array) of the same length as the list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shap_1_names, shap_2_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>The character vector containing the names
of the columns in <code>shap_1</code> and <code>shap_2</code>, respectively.  These must be in
the same order as the columns themselves.  If a list is passed to one of
the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠shap_*⁠</code> arguments, it does NOT affect the corresponding
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠shap_*_names⁠</code> argument, which will still be a single character vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function allows the user to input the SHAP values for two separate
models (along with the expected values), and mSHAP then outputs the SHAP
values of the two model predictions multiplied together.
</p>
<p>An included feature of the function is the ability to pass data frames
that do not have the same number of columns. Say for instance that one
model benefits from a certain variable but the other does not. As long
as the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠shap_*_names⁠</code> arguments are supplied, the function will
automatically add a column of 0's for missing variables in either data frame
(matrix). This corresponds to a SHAP value of 0, which of course is accurate
if the variable was not included in the model.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing the multiplied SHAP values and the expected value.
Or, in the case of a list passed as one of the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠shap_*⁠</code> augments, a list
of lists where each element corresponds to the same element in the list
passed to <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠shap_*⁠</code>.
