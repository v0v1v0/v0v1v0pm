<h2>msltrend: A package providing improved techniques to estimate trend, velocity
and acceleration from sea level records.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 'msltrend' package provides improved estimates of trend (mean sea
level) and associated real-time velocities and accelerations from long (minimum
80 years), individual, annual average ocean water level data records. Improved
trend estimates are based on Singular Spectrum Analysis methods. Various gap-filling
options are included to accommodate incomplete time series records. The package
also contains a forecasting module to consider the implication of user defined
quantum of sea level rise between the end of the available historical record
and the year 2100. A wide range of screen and pdf plotting options are available
within the package.
</p>


<h3>msltrend functions</h3>

<p>The <code>msl.trend</code> function is the key entry point to the package
deconstructing annual average time series data records into a trend and
associated real-time velocities and accelerations, filling necessary internal
structures which facilitate all functions in this package (Refer Watson 2016a,b
for more detail).
</p>
<p>The <code>msl.forecast</code> function enables a user defined quantum of sea
level rise to be added from the end of the deconstructed historical record to
the year 2100. Similalrly, this function estimates real-time velocities and
accelerations from the start of the available historical record to the year 2100.
