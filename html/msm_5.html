<h2>Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome after lung transplants</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing histories of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)
from lung transplant recipients. BOS is a chronic decline in lung function,
often observed after lung transplantation.  The condition is classified into
four stages of severity: none, mild, moderate and severe.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame containing 638 rows, grouped by patient, including
histories of 204 patients.  The first observation for each patient is
defined to be stage 1, no BOS, at six months after transplant.  Subsequent
observations denote the entry times into stages 2, 3, 4, representing mild,
moderate and severe BOS respectively, and stage 5, representing death.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The entry time of each patient into each stage of BOS was estimated by
clinicians, based on their history of lung function measurements and acute
rejection and infection episodes.  BOS is only assumed to occur beyond six
months after transplant.  In the first six months the function of each
patient's new lung stabilises.  Subsequently BOS is diagnosed by comparing
the lung function against the "baseline" value.
</p>
<p>The objects <code>bos3</code> and <code>bos4</code> contain the same data, but with
mild/moderate/severe combined, and moderate/severe combined, to give 3 and
4-state representations respectively.
