<h2>Likelihood ratio test</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Likelihood ratio test between two or more fitted multi-state models
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lrtest.msm(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Two or more fitted multi-state models, as returned by
<code>msm</code>, ordered by increasing numbers of parameters.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with three columns, giving the likelihood ratio statistic,
difference in degrees of freedom and the chi-squared p-value for a
comparison of the first model supplied with each subsequent model.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>The comparison between models will only be valid if they
are fitted to the same dataset. This may be a problem if there are missing
values and R's default of 'na.action = na.omit' is used.
</p>
<p>The likelihood ratio statistic only has the indicated chi-squared
distribution if the models are nested. An alternative for comparing
non-nested models is Akaike's information criterion.  This can be computed
for one or more fitted <code>msm</code> models <code>x,y,...</code> using
<code>AIC(x,y,...)</code>.
