<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Print a fitted msm model object

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is the new method of formatting msm objects for printing.  The old
method was based on printing lists of matrices. That produced a lot of
wasted space for parameters which were zero, and it was difficult to match
corresponding numbers between matrices. The new method presents all the
transition intensities and covariate effects as a single compact table, and
likewise for misclassification matrices.
</p>
<p>Also in the old method, covariate effects were presented as log hazard
ratios or log odds ratios.  The log scale is more convenient mathematically,
but unnatural to interpret.  The new method presents hazard ratios for
covariates on transition intensities and odds ratios for misclassification
probabilities.
</p>
<p><code>printnew.msm</code> is an alias for <code>print.msm</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The object returned by <code>print.msm</code> is a numeric matrix with one
column for each estimate or confidence limit for intensities and their
covariates, in the same arrangement as printed, but with the underlying
numbers in full precision.  The results formatted for printing are stored in
the <code>"formatted"</code> attribute of the object, as a character matrix.
These can alternatively be produced by <code>msm.form.qoutput</code>, which
has no printing side-effect. <code>msm.form.eoutput</code> produces the
same arrangement for misclassification probabilities instead of intensities.
