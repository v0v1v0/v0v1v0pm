<h2>Developer documentation: model for covariates on transition intensities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list representing the model for covariates on transition intensities
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>npars</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of covariate effect parameters.  This is defined
as the number of covariates on intensities (with factors expanded as
contrasts) multiplied by the number of allowed transitions in the model.
</p>
<p>Note if <code>msm</code> was called with <code>covariates</code> set to a list of
different covariates for different intensities, then this will include
covariate effects that are implicitly defined as zero by this list.  The
information in <code>paramdata</code> objects can be
used to identify wich ones are fixed at zero.
</p>
<p>This also includes any <code>timeperiod</code> covariates in a time-inhomogeneous
model defined by the <code>pci</code> option to <code>msm</code>.  </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ndpars</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of distinct covariate effect parameters, as
<code>npars</code>, but after any equality constraints have been applied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ncovs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of covariates on intensities, with factors expanded as
contrasts.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>constr</code></td>
<td>
<p>List of equality constraints on these covariate
effects, as supplied in the <code>constraint</code> argument to
<code>msm</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>covlabels</code></td>
<td>
<p>Names / labels of these covariates in
the model matrix (see <code>model.matrix.msm</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inits</code></td>
<td>
<p>Initial
values for these covariate effects, as a vector formed from the
<code>covinits</code> list supplied to <code>msm</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>covmeans</code></td>
<td>
<p>Means
of these covariates in the data (excluding data not required to fit the
model, such as observations with missing data in other elements or subjects'
last observations).  This includes means of 0/1 factor contrasts as well as
continuous covariates (for historic reasons, which may not be sensible).</p>
