<h2>Histamine in Dogs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Sixteen dogs were treated with drugs to see the effects on their blood
histamine levels. The dogs were split into four groups: Two groups received
the drugmorphine, and two received the drug trimethaphan, both given
intravenously. For one group within each pair of drug groups, the dogs had
their supply of histamine depleted before treatment, while the other group
had histamine intact. (Measurements with the value "0.10" marked data that
was missing and, were filled with that value arbitrarily.)
