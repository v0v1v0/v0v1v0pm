<h2>A Toy Example of 1000 Respondents Working on a Multistage Test</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data of 1000 respondents working on a multistage test using a (1,2,2) design. The responses were generated
based on the 2PL model. Each module consists of 7 items. Data were generated using the mstR package, version 1.2
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mstR/index.html).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">toydata
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with 7 elements:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>resp</dt>
<dd>
<p>The response matrix, with rows corresponding to respondents and columns corresponding to items.</p>
</dd>
<dt>it</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix of item parameters. The columns contain the discrimination, difficulty, pseudo-guessing and 
inattention parameters of the 4PL model. The discrimination parameters were drawn from a N(1,0.2) distribution.
The difficulty parameters were drawn from normal distributions. For module 1 (items 1-7), this distributions was N(0,1),
for modules 2 and 4 (items 8-14 and 22-28) it was N(1,1) and for modules 3 and 5 (items 15-21 and 29-35)
the distribution was N(-1,1).</p>
</dd>
<dt>theta</dt>
<dd>
<p>The true ability parameters.</p>
</dd>
<dt>theta_est</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ability parameters estimated by the WLE estimator.</p>
</dd>
<dt>group_categ</dt>
<dd>
<p>A simulated categorical person covariate. The first 500 respondents belong to group 0, the remaining 500
respondents to group 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>group_cont</dt>
<dd>
<p>A simulated continuous person covariate. It simulates an age covariate, with a uniform distribution between
20 and 60.</p>
</dd>
<dt>see_est</dt>
<dd>
<p>The standard errors of the estimated ability parameters.</p>
</dd>
