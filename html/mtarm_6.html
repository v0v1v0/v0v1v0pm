<h2>Rainfall and two river flows in Colombia</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data represent daily rainfall (in mm) and two river
flows (in <code class="reqn">m^3</code>/s) in southern Colombia. A meteorological station located
with an altitude of 2400 meters was used to measure rainfall. In the
first case, the El Trebol hydrological station was used to measure the
flow in the Bedon river at an altitude of 1720 meters. In the second
case, the Villalosada hydrological station measured the flow in the
La Plata river at an altitude of 1300 meters. Geographically, the
stations are located near the equator. The last characteristic allows
for control over hydrological and meteorological factors that might
distort a dynamic relationship. January 1, 2006, to April 14, 2009,
is the sample period.
