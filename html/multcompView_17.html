<h2>plot multcomp displays</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Helper functions for plot.multcompTs and plot.multcompLetters.  These not
intended to be called directly and are hidden in a namespace.  You can use
'getAnywhere' to see them.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">plotLetters(
  obj,
  at,
  horizontal,
  col,
  add,
  label.levels,
  font.family = "mono",
  fig = par("fig"),
  mar = par("mar"),
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix describing which levels (rows) will be plotted with
which groups (columns).  For plotTs and plotBoxes, obj is a matrix of
numbers from (-1, 0, 1).  For plotLetters, obj is a logical matrix = TRUE if
that "letter" (group or column of obj) is to be plotted with that level (row
of obj).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>at</code></td>
<td>
<p>an array with one row for each level and 3 columns giving low,
middle and high levels for the display for that level.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>horizontal</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical scalar indicating whether the list of items
compared reads left to right (horizontal = TRUE) or top to bottom
(horizontal = FALSE).  If this multcomp graphic accompanies boxplots for
different levels or groups compared, the 'boxplot' argument 'horizontal' is
the negation of the multcomp plot 'horizontal' argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>col</code></td>
<td>
<p>The color for each group of items or factor levels.  The colors
will cross the different items or factor levels and will therefore have the
orientation specified via 'horizontal'.  If the number of columns exceeds
length(col), col is recycled.  For alternative choices for col, see "Color
Specification" in the <code>par</code> help page.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>add</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE to add to an existing plot; FALSE to start a new plot.  The
names of the factor levels or items compared will be plotted only if
add=FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>label.levels</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distance from the plot region to print the names of the
levels as a proportion of the plot range; NA for no level labels.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>font.family</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string naming the font family used by
"plotLetters".  This function plots the different "Letters" in different
colors by plotting one color at a time.  It's currently not smart enough to
align the letters properly except by assuming a mono-spaced font.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fig</code></td>
<td>
<p>figure region = (x0, x1, y0, y1) as a proportion of the device
region.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mar</code></td>
<td>
<p>margin = (lower, left, upper, right) in lines.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>graphical parameters can be given as described on the
<code>plot</code> help page or the <code>gpar</code> help page.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The requested graphic is either plotted by itself or added to an existing
plot as specified by the arguments.
</p>
<p>"plotTs" and "plotBoxes" use traditional R graphics and will not be
discussed further here.
</p>
<p>"plotLetters" uses 'grid' graphics, because it seems to provide more support
for controlling the side-by-side placement of "Letters" of possibly
different colors and widths.  The "Letters" display will be positioned in
the "plot region" defined by fig and mar, assuming the entire device region
is 37 lines both wide and tall.  Thus, the plot region is diff(fig[1:2])*37
lines wide and diff(fig(1:2])*37 lines high.  If, for example, fig = c(0.9,
1, 0, 1), this makes the plot region 3.7 lines wide.  With the default
mar=c(5, 4, 4, 2)+0.1 lines, the "width" of the plot region is therefore 3.7
- (4.1+2.1) = (-2.5) lines.  "plotLetters" initially ignores this
contradictory negative width, and centers the plot at the midpoint of h0 =
fig[1]+mar[2]/37, h1 = fig[2]-mar[4]/37, v0 = fig[3]+mar[1]/37, and v1 =
fig[4]-mar[3]/37.  The "Letters" for the different levels compared are
rescaled from at[, "center"] to fit inside At.rng = if(horizontal) c(h0, h1)
else c(v0, v1).  With "n" levels compared and at.rng = range(at[,
"center"]), at[, "center"] is expanded to (at.rng+/-0.5) and rescaled to
match At.rng; if(diff(At.rng)&lt;=0), an error message is issued.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the "Letters" are centered at the midpoint of W.rng =
if(horizontal) c(v0, v1) else v(h0, h1) [the opposite of At.rng]; the
argument "width" used by plotTs and plotBoxes is not used (and not even
accepted) by plotLetters.  If(label.levels), these are positioned in the
midpoint of the right margin in the "W" direction.
