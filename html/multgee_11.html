<h2>A GEE Solver For Correlated Nominal Or Ordinal Multinomial Responses</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A generalized estimating equations (GEE) solver for fitting marginal
regression models with correlated nominal or ordinal multinomial responses
based on a local odds ratios parameterization for the association structure.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package contains two functions that fit GEE models for correlated
multinomial responses; ordLORgee for an ordinal response scale and
nomLORgee for a nominal response scale.
</p>
<p>The main arguments in both functions are: (i) an optional data frame
(<code>data</code>), (ii) a model formula (<code>formula</code>), (iii) a cluster
identifier variable (<code>id</code>) and (iv) an optional vector that identifies
the order of the observations within each cluster (<code>repeated</code>).
</p>
<p>Options for the marginal model in the function ordLORgee include
cumulative link models or an adjacent categories logit model. A marginal
baseline category logit model is offered in the function nomLORgee.
For the form of the linear predictor in these models, see the <code>Details</code>
sections in nomLORgee and ordLORgee.
</p>
<p>The association structure among the correlated multinomial responses is
expressed via marginalized local odds ratios (<cite>Touloumis et al.,
2013</cite>). The estimating procedure for the local odds ratios can be summarized
as follows: For each level pair of the <code>repeated</code> variable, the
available responses are aggregated across clusters to form a square
marginalized contingency table.  Treating these tables as independent, an
RC-G(1) type model (<cite>Becker and Clogg, 1989</cite>) is fitted in order to
estimate the marginalized local odds ratios. The <code>LORstr</code> argument
determines the form of the marginalized local odds ratios structure. Since
the general RC-G(1) model is closely related to the family of association
models (<cite>Goodman, 1985</cite>), one can instead fit an association model to
each of the marginalized contingency tables by setting <code>LORem="2way"</code>.
</p>
<p>If the underlying association pattern does not change dramatically across
the level pairs of <code>repeated</code> then parsimonious marginalized local odds
ratios should sufficiently approximate the true underlying association
structure. To assess the underlying association structure, one might use the
utility function intrinsic.pars.
</p>
<p>Instead of estimating the local odds ratios structure, a user-defined
structure can be provided by setting <code>LORstr=</code>"<code>fixed</code>". In this
case, the utility function matrixLOR is useful in constructing the
required <code>LORterm</code> argument.
</p>
<p>The function waldts provides a goodness-of-fit test between two
nested GEE models based on a Wald test statistic.
