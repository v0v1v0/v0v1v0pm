<h2>Simulated data with exposure misclassification and outcome misclassification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data containing two sources of bias, three known confounders, and
100,000 observations. This data is obtained from <code>df_emc_omc_source</code>
by removing the columns <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. The resulting data corresponds
to what a researcher would see in the real-world: a misclassified exposure,
<em>Xstar</em>, and a misclassified outcome, <em>Ystar</em>. As seen in
<code>df_em_om_source</code>, the true, unbiased exposure-outcome
odds ratio = 2.
