<h2>Simulated data with exposure misclassification and selection bias</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data containing two sources of bias, three known confounders, and
100,000 observations. This data is obtained by sampling with replacement
with probability = <em>S</em> from <code>df_em_sel_source</code> then removing the
columns <em>X</em> and <em>S</em>. The resulting data corresponds to what a
researcher would see in the real-world: a misclassified exposure,
<em>Xstar</em>, and missing data for those not selected into the study
(<em>S</em>=0). As seen in <code>df_em_sel_source</code>, the true, unbiased
exposure-outcome odds ratio = 2.
