<h2>Simulated data with outcome misclassification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data containing one source of bias, three known confounders, and
100,000 observations. This data is obtained from <code>df_om_source</code>
by removing the column <em>Y</em>. The resulting data corresponds to
what a researcher would see in the real-world: a misclassified outcome,
<em>Ystar</em>, and no data on the true outcome. As seen in
<code>df_om_source</code>, the true, unbiased exposure-outcome odds ratio = 2.
</p>
