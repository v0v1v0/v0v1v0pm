<h2>Simulated data with selection bias</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data containing one source of bias, three known confounders, and 100,000
observations. This data is obtained by sampling with replacement with
probability = <em>S</em> from <code>df_sel_source</code> then removing the <em>S</em>
column. The resulting data corresponds to what a researcher would see
in the real-world: missing data for those not selected into the study
(<em>S</em>=0). As seen in <code>df_sel_source</code>, the true, unbiased
exposure-outcome odds ratio = 2.
