<h2>Simulated data with uncontrolled confounding</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data containing one source of bias, three known confounders, and
100,000 observations. This data is obtained from <code>df_uc_source</code>
by removing the column <em>U</em>. The resulting data corresponds to
what a researcher would see in the real-world: information on known
confounders (<em>C1</em>, <em>C2</em>, and <em>C3</em>), but not for
confounder <em>U</em>.
As seen in <code>df_uc_source</code>, the true, unbiased exposure-outcome
effect estimate = 2.
