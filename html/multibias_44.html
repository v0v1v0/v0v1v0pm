<h2>Simulated data with uncontrolled confounding and selection bias</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data containing two sources of bias, three known confounders, and 100,000
observations. This data is obtained by sampling with replacement with
probability = <em>S</em> from <code>df_uc_sel_source</code> then removing
the columns <em>U</em> and <em>S</em>. The resulting data corresponds to
what a researcher would see
in the real-world: missing data on confounder <em>U</em>; and missing data for
those not selected into the study (<em>S</em>=0). As seen in
<code>df_uc_sel_source</code>, the true, unbiased exposure-outcome odds ratio = 2.
