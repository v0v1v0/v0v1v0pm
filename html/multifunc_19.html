<h2>getOverlap</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>getOverlap</code> goes through all m-wise combinations of species
and returns the amount of overlap between species in functions they perform
for each combination
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getOverlap(
  overData,
  m = 2,
  type = "positive",
  index = "sorensen",
  denom = "set"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overData</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix of functions and which species affect them from <code>getRedundancy</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of functions. Defaults to 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Are the kinds of effects we're looking at "positive", "negative" or "all".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>index</code></td>
<td>
<p>Type of overlap index to be used. Defaults to "sorenson" but currently incorporates
"mountford" and "jaccard" as well.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>denom</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the denominator be "all" species or just the "set" of species with the types
of interactions being considered? Defaults to "set".</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>getOverlap takes a matrix of 1s and -1s, and depending on whether we're
interested in positive, negative, or both types of interactions looks for the
m-wise overlap between species and returns the overlap index for each combination
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a vector of overlap indices.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(all_biodepth)
allVars &lt;- qw(biomassY3, root3, N.g.m2, light3, N.Soil, wood3, cotton3)

germany &lt;- subset(all_biodepth, all_biodepth$location == "Germany")

vars &lt;- whichVars(germany, allVars)
species &lt;- relevantSp(germany, 26:ncol(germany))

# re-normalize N.Soil so that everything is on the
# same sign-scale (e.g. the maximum level of a function is the "best" function)
germany$N.Soil &lt;- -1 * germany$N.Soil + max(germany$N.Soil, na.rm = TRUE)

res.list &lt;- lapply(vars, function(x) sAICfun(x, species, germany))

redund &lt;- getRedundancy(vars, species, germany)
