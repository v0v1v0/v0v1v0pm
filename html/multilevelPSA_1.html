<h2>Multilevel Propensity Score Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This packages provides functions to estimate and visualize multilevel propensity
score analysis.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package extends the principles put forth by the <code>PSAgraphics</code> 
(Helmreich, Pruzek, &amp; Xiong, 2010) for multilevel, or clustered, data.
</p>
<p>Propensity score analyses are typically done in two phases. In phase I, a
statistical model predicting treatment using the available individual covariates 
is estimated. This package currently currently provides functions to perform
propensity score estimates using logistic regression (see <code>mlpsa.logistic</code>)
and conditional inference trees (see <code>mlpsa.ctree</code>). The latter method
provides explicit stratifications as defined by each leaf node. The former however,
results in a numerical value ranging from zero to one (i.e. the fitted values).
A common approach is to then create stratifications using quintiles. However,
other approaches such as Loess regression are also provided.
</p>
<p>Phase II of typical propensity score analyses concerns with the comparison of an
outcome between the treatment and comparison groups. The <code>mlpsa</code>
method will perform this analysis in a multilevel, or clustered, fashion. That
is, the results of the <code>mlpsa</code> procedure produce summary results
at level one (i.e. each strata within each cluster), level two (i.e. overall results
for each cluster), and overall (i.e. overall results across all clusters).
</p>
<p>This package also provides a number of visualizations that provide a critical
part in presenting, understanding, and interpreting the results. See
<code>plot.mlpsa</code> for details.
