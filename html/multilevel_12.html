<h2>Create Coding Matrix for Discontinuous Growth Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates time-varying covariates for estimating a discontinuous
growth model (DGM). Creating time-varying covariates requires only simple recoding
of a time vector when data are balanced and the discontinuity event occurs
at the same time for each group. When data are not balanced and one or more
events occurs at different times for each group, coding the time-varying
covariates is complex. For instance, if the event of interest was employee turnover
in a store in a given month, it is likely that stores would differ on how many months 
of data were available and on the specific months when turnover occurred. With these
irregularly-timed events and different time windows for each store, 
it would be challenging to create time-varying covariates for the DGM specific to each
store's circumstances.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dgm.code(grp,time,event,n.events=FALSE,first.obs=FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>grp</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector representing the group ID in the panel data. Each group ID
is repeated n times as represented in the panel.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector from 0:n-1 where n represents the number of observations
within each panel. Within each group, the time vector can vary in length.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>event</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing 1 for each time the event of interest for a
group occurs and a 0 in all other cases.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.events</code></td>
<td>
<p>Controls how many events for which to create time-varying
covariates. In cases where some groups encounter numerous events, this argument
can be used to limit the coding to a small number (e.g., 2 or 3). Default is to create
as many time related covariates as occur in the group with the most events (which
is often not useful).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>first.obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Controls what to do if the first observation is an event. If
TRUE, then the first observation is changed to a zero and treated as a non-event. If FALSE,
the function provides a list of the groups where the event is the first observation.
The reason why the first observation is flagged is that it is not possible to estimate
a discontinuous growth model if the event occurs on the first observation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Produces a data.frame with the columns
</p>
<p>[, c("grp","time","event","trans1","post1","time.a","tot.events","event.first")]
</p>
<p>If numerous events are coded,
the data.frame will contain more trans and post values (trans2, post2, etc.) corresponding to the maximum
number of events experienced by a group unless n.events is set to limit the number of
events. The data.frame must be merged back to the original data.frame for subsequent
analyses. See examples.</p>
