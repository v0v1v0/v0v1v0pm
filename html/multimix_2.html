<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are twelve pre-trial covariates measured on each patient,
seven may be taken to be continuous, four to be discrete, and one 
variable (SG) is an index nearly all of whose values lie between 
7 and 15, and which could be considered either discrete or continuous. 
We will treat SG as a continuous variable.
</p>
<p>A preliminary inspection of the data showed that the sizeof the 
primary tumour (SZ) and serum prostatic acid phosphatase (AP) were 
both skewed variables. These variables have therefore been transformed. 
A square root transformation was used for SZ, and a logarithmic
transformation was used for AP to achieve approximate normality. 
(As for correlation, skewness over the whole data set does not 
necessarily mean skewness within clusters. But when clusters were 
formed, within-cluster skewness was observed for these variables.) 
</p>
<p>Observations that had missing values in any of the twelve pretreatment 
covariates were omitted from furtheranalysis, leaving 475 out of the 
original 506 observations available. 
</p>
<p>The categorical variable <code>Patient activity</code> had 4 levels: 'Normally 
Active', 'Bed rest below 50
or more', and 'Confined to bed'. The numbers of the 475 in these groups were
428, 32, 12, and 3. The least active two groups are grouped in our data,
giving 3 groups of size 428, 32, and 15.
