<h2>Initialise the parameter list.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Although the starting parameter list <code>P</code> may be specified directly, 
Note also that any matrices specified must be positive definite.
This function calculates an initial <code>P</code> from <code>D</code> and a starting
value for <code>Z</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">initParamList(D, Z)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>D</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>multimixSettings</code>—see
<code>data_organise</code> for details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Z</code></td>
<td>
<p>an <code class="reqn">n \times q</code> matrix, where <code class="reqn">n</code> is the number
of rows of <code>dframe</code> and <code class="reqn">q</code> is the number of components in the
mixture. During the fitting <code class="reqn">Z_{ij}</code> holds the currently estimated
probability that observation <code class="reqn">i</code> belongs to component <code class="reqn">j</code>.
Often <code>Z</code> is initialized to a matrix of indicator columns for a
partition of the data. It is also common to initialize <code>Z</code> to be the
final <code>Z</code> from the fitting of a simpler model.</p>
