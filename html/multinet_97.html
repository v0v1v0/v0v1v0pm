Functions to extract neighbors of vertices, to navigate the network
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These functions return actors who are connected to the input actor through an edge. They can be used to navigate the graph, following paths inside it.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">neighbors_ml(n, actor, layers = character(0), mode = "all")
xneighbors_ml(n, actor, layers = character(0), mode = "all")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>A multilayer network.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>actor</code></td>
<td>
<p>An actor name present in the network, whose neighbors are extracted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>layers</code></td>
<td>
<p>An array of layers belonging to the network. Only the nodes in these layers are returned. If the array is empty, all the nodes in the network are returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
<p>This argument can take values "in", "out" or "all" to indicate respectively neighbors reachable via incoming edges, via outgoing edges or both.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>neighbors_ml</code> returns the actors who are connected to the input actor on at least one of the specified layers. <code>xneighbors_ml</code> (eXclusive neighbors) returns the actors who are connected to the input actor on at least one of the specified layers, and on none of the other layers. Exclusive neighbors are those neighbors that would be lost by removing the input layers.
