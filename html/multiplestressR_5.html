<h2>Generate Summary Figures</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Using the output from <code>classify_interactions</code> function, summary figures can be created using this function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">summary_plots(
  effect_size_dataframe,
  Small_Sample_Correction,
  Significance_Level
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>effect_size_dataframe</code></td>
<td>
<p>Output from the <code>classify_interactions</code> function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Small_Sample_Correction</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether the correction for small sample sizes should be enacted
(TRUE or FALSE; default is TRUE) <em>Note that if the multiplicative null model (see <code>effect_size_multiplicative</code>)
was implemented, this parameter is not used and can be ignored.
If the additive null model (see <code>effect_size_additive</code>) was implemented, then this
parameter should be assigned the same value as in that analysis</em>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Significance_Level</code></td>
<td>
<p>The value of alpha for which confidence intervals are calculated
(numeric, between 0 and 1; default is 0.05) <em>Note that if the multiplicative null model (see <code>effect_size_multiplicative</code>)
was implemented, this parameter is not used and can be ignored.
If the additive null model (see <code>effect_size_additive</code>) was implemented, then this
parameter should be assigned the same value as in that analysis</em>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The figures include:
</p>
<p>a) The proportions of the different interaction classifications from the dataset
</p>
<p>b) Median sample sizes plotted against effect size (different interaction classifications are highlighted).
Where the additive null model was used in the analysis, lines for critical effect sizes are plotted
(see <code>critical_effect_size_additive</code> function).
</p>
<p>c) Density of different median sample sizes.
</p>
<p>d) Inverse of effect size variance plotted against effect size (i.e., one iteration of a funnel plot).
</p>
<p>e) Effect size standard error (i.e., the square root of the effect size variance) plotted against effect size (i.e., one iteration of a funnel plot)).
</p>
<p>Note that c - e) are most useful for researchers conducting a meta-analysis.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a series of figures each of which is outlined above.
</p>
