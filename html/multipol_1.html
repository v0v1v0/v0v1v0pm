<h2>Multivariate polynomials</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Various tools to manipulate and combine multivariate polynomials
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Multidimensional arrays are interpreted in a natural way as multivariate
polynomials.
</p>
<p>Taking a matrix <code>a</code> as an example, because this has two dimensions
it may be viewed as a bivariate polynomial with <code>a[i,j]</code> being the
coefficient of <code class="reqn">x^iy^j</code>.  Note the off-by-one issue; see
<code>?Extract</code>.
</p>
<p>Multivariate polynomials of arbitrary arity are a straightforward
generalization using appropriately dimensioned arrays.
</p>
<p>Arithmetic operations “<code>+</code>”,“<code>-</code>”,
“<code>*</code>”, “<code>^</code>” operate as though their arguments
are multivariate polynomials.
</p>
<p>Even quite small multipols are computationally intense; many
coefficients have to be calculated and each is the sum of many terms.
</p>
<p>The package is almost completely superceded by the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spray"><span class="pkg">spray</span></a> and
<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mvp"><span class="pkg">mvp</span></a> packages, which use a sparse array system for efficiency.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
ones(2)*linear(c(1,-1))                             # x^2-y^2
ones(2)*(ones(2,2)-uni(2))                          # x^3+y^3
