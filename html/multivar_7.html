<h2>Simulated multi-VAR data.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset contains multivariate time series data for k = 9 individuals with 
$d = 10$ variables collected at $t = 100$ equidistant time points. The data was 
generated such that each individual's VAR(1) transition matrix has 20 percent 
nonzero entries. This means, for example, each individual has 20 nonzero directed 
relationships in their data generating model. The position of non-zero elements 
in each individual's transition matrix was selected randomly given the following 
constraints: 2/3 of  each individual's paths are shared by all individuals, 
and 1/3 are unique to each individual. For each individual, coefficient values 
between U(0,1, 0.9) were randomly drawn until stability conditions for the 
VAR model were satisfied.
