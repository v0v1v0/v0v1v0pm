Dataset due to McNeall
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data, due to McNeall, from 92 runs of a climate model
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(mcneall)</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>McNeall used a numerical climate model and ran it 92 times, on a design
matrix specified on 16 independent variables as detailed in McNeall
2008.
</p>
<p>The model output is a temperature distribution over the surface of the
Earth.  The model gives 2048 temperatures, corresponding to 2048 grid
squares distributed over the Earth.  A vector of 2048 temperatures may
be displayed on a global map using the <code>showmap()</code> function.
</p>
<p>The 92 model runs are presented in the form of a 2048 by 92 matrix
<code>mcneall_temps</code>, each column of which corresponds to a run.  A row
of 92 temperatures corresponds to the temperature at a particular place
on the earth as predicted by each of the 92 model runs.
</p>
<p>Following McNeall, a principal component analysis on the maps was
performed.  The first four were used.  Matrix <code>eigenmaps</code> is a 2048
by 4 matrix, with columns corresponding to the four principal
components.  
</p>
<p>Matrix <code>mcneall_pc</code> is a 92-by-20 matrix.  The first 16 columns
correspond to the independent variables (ie the design matrix); columns
17-20 correspond to the first four principal components of the model
output.  The 92 rows correspond to the 92 model runs.
</p>
<p>The package can be used on the <code>mcneall_temps</code> matrix; use
<code>apart()</code> to generate a <code>mdm</code> object.  A reasonably optimized
hyperparameters object of class <code>mhp</code> is given as
<code>opt_mcneall</code>.
