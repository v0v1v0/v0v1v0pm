<h2>Survey to study the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the responses to the survey conducted by Durante, Rae, and Griskevicius (2013)
in their study, <em>The
fluctuating female vote: Politics, religion, and the ovulatory cycle</em>.
Durante et al. study effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes.
Steegen, Tuerlinckx, Gelman, and Vanpaemel (2016) used this dataset in their analysis to illustrate how a
multiverse analysis can highlight the robustness of the conclusions reached by the original author.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 502 rows and 26 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Abortion</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Abortion is a women’s [sic] right."</p>
</dd>
<dt>DateTesting</dt>
<dd>
<p>Date of participant filling in the questionnaire.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Donate</dt>
<dd>
<p>"For the next part of the study we will donate $1 to the presidential
campaign of your preferred candidate. Please indicate which candidate’s campaign
you would like us to donate $1 to.” Mitt Romney — Barack Obama"</p>
</dd>
<dt>FreeMarket</dt>
<dd>
<p>"In nearly every instance, the free market allocates resources most efficiently."</p>
</dd>
<dt>Marijuana</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Marijuana should be legal."</p>
</dd>
<dt>Marriage</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Marriage is between a man and a woman."</p>

<dt>PrivSocialSec</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Privatize Social Security." 1 – 7</p>
</dd>
<dt>Profit</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Business corporations make too much profit."</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rel1</dt>

(2) dating or involved with only one partner,
(3) engaged or living with my partner,
(4) married, or
(5) other. If participants picked response (5), they were prompted to provide a description of their
relationship, which was subsequently coded into one of the four options by the
original authors. The data here has already been coded into another response option. </p>
</dd>
<dt>ReportedCycleLength</dt>
<dd>
<p>How many days long are your menstrual cycles? (for most
women, the range is between 25-35 days) Keep in mind this is the number of
days from the start of one menstrual period to the start of the next menstrual
period and NOT the length of your menstrual bleeding.</p>

<dd>
<p>"Government should ensure that all citizens meet a certain minimum standard of living"</p>
</dd>
<dt>StartDateNext</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicates the expected start date of their next menstrual period
(the research material does not contain a question about the variable. However,
the data file for Study 2 contained this variable.)</p>
</dd>
<dt>StartDateofLastPeriod</dt>
<dd>
<p>Please give your best estimate of the date on which
you started your last period (please be as precise as possible). This date was
probably within the last few weeks. Sometimes thinking of where you were when
you started your last period helps. For instance, was it on a weekend?, were you
at work, was it during a football game?, etc. Please write the date in
mm/dd/yyyy format (e.g., 8/18/2012).</p>
</dd>
<dt>StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast</dt>
<dd>
<p>Please give your best estimate of the date on
which you started the period before your last period (please be as precise as
possible). Please write the date in mm/dd/yyyy format (e.g., 7/18/2012).”</p>
</dd>
<dt>StemCell</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Stem cell research is moral and can be useful for science."</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sure1</dt>
<dd>
<p>"How sure are you about that date (StartDateofLastPeriod)?"</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sure2</dt>
<dd>
<p>How sure are you about that date (StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast)?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vote</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Imagine walking into the voting booth today. Who would you vote for in the
presidential election?” Mitt Romney (republican) – Barack Obama (democrat)"</p>

<dd>
<p> ID of participant </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All questions were preceded by the prompt — "Please indicate how much you agree
with the following statements"
</p>
<p>The following items were responses to  religiosity items (on a scale of 1 - 9):
<em>Rel1</em>, <em>Rel2</em>, <em>Rel3</em>
</p>
<p>The following items were responses to fiscal political attitudes items (on a scale of 1 - 7):
<em>RichTax</em>, <em>TooMuchProfit</em>, <em>StandardLiving</em>, <em>FreeMarket</em>, <em>PrivSocialSec</em>
</p>
<p>The following items were responses to social political attitudes items (on a scale of 1 - 7):
<em>Abortion</em>, <em>Marriage</em>, <em>StemCell</em>, <em>Marijuana</em>, <em>RestrictAbortion</em>
</p>
<p>In addition, the values of <em>StartDateofLastPeriod</em>, <em>StartDateofPeriodBeforeLast</em> 
and <em>StartDateNext</em> are missing for WorkerID 15 and 16. This impacts the calculation of 
<em>CycleDay</em> variable in the dataset. Steegen et al. "reconstructed this variable
for their analysis after fixing some coding errors". To ensure that their results were identical
to Durante et al.'s, they used the processed variable Cycle Day from the original data file 
(11 and 18 for WorkerIDs 15 and 16, respectively).
