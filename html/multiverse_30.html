<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset for the study conducted by Jung et al. (2014)
in their study, <em>Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes</em>.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 502 rows and 26 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Year</dt>
<dd>
<p>Year in which the hurricane occurred</p>

<dd>
<p>A score of how Masculine or Feminine a hurricane is, 
on a scale of 1 - 11  where 1 is the most masculine and 11 is the most 
feminine. Each hurricane was rated by 9 independent coders</p>
</dd>
<dt>MinPressure_before</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimum pressure of hurricanes at the time of landfall in the United States
obtained from NOAA (www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/All_U.S._Hurricanes.html)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Minpressure_Updated_2014</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimum pressure of hurricanes at the time of landfall in the United States
obtained from NOAA (www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/All_U.S._Hurricanes.html)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gender_MF</dt>

<dd>
<p>Total number of deaths caused by the hurricane. Information on death tolls 
of hurricanes were obtained primarily from monthly weather reports in the digital archive of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/mwr_pdf/)</p>
</dd>
<dt>HighestWindSpeed</dt>
<dd>
<p>The maximum wind speed of hurricanes at the time of landfall in the
United States obtained from NOAA (www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/All_U.S._Hurricanes.html). 
This data is only available for storms after 1979</p>
</dd>
<dt>NDAM</dt>
<dd>
<p>normalized damage (in million $)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Source</dt>
<dd>
<p>Source from where the data was gathered</p>
</dd>
<dt>Elapsed.Yrs</dt>
<dd>
<p>Time since hurricane</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This dataset was collated by Jung et. al in their study <em>Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes</em>
They hypothesised that hurricanes with more feminine names might be perceived as less dangerous and hence lead to 
people taking fewer precautionary measures, resulting in more death and damages.
