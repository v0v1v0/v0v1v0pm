<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data collected by Jansen et al. in their study,
<em>Evaluating the Efficiency of Physical Visualizations</em>
which investigated factors contributing to the efficiency of physical visualizations.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 512 observations and 19 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>subject</dt>
<dd>
<p>Subject identifier</p>
</dd>
<dt>group</dt>
<dd>
<p> Group / experiment session number in which the participant was involved in the experiment</p>
</dd>
<dt>formerSubject</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes/No. Whether subject had participated in a previous experiment conducted by Jansen et al. </p>
</dd>
<dt>conditionrank</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>modalityname</dt>
<dd>
<p>Name of the modality of interaction. One of "Virtual Mouse", "Virtual prop", "Physical touch", "Physical no-touch"</p>
</dd>
<dt>repetition</dt>
<dd>
<p> 1/2. Whether the participant was interacting with the visualization for the first time.
Participants interacted with visualizations of two different datasets and this variable stores the order.</p>
</dd>
<dt>modality</dt>
<dd>
<p>Index of the modality of interaction</p>
</dd>
<dt>question</dt>
<dd>
<p> Index of question asked to the participant as part of the experiment.
Each participant was asked 4 questions. All questions involved a comparison task. </p>
</dd>
<dt>trial</dt>
<dd>
<p> Each participant performed 32 trials. Participants answered 4 questions
for 8 different datasets which resulted in 32 trials per participant. </p>
</dd>
<dt>datasetname</dt>
<dd>
<p> Each participant was presented with 8 different datasets through the visualizations.
These were: "army", "carmortality", "education" "externaldebt", "grosscapital", "health", "hiv", "military"</p>
</dd>
<dt>readingTime</dt>
<dd>
<p> Time taken by participant to read the visualization in seconds </p>
</dd>
<dt>error</dt>
<dd>
<p> If the question was answered correctly by the participants. </p>
</dd>
<dt>duration</dt>
<dd>
<p> If the question was answered correctly by the participants. </p>
</dd>
<dt>perceivedDifficulty</dt>
<dd>
<p> Self reported perceived difficulty of the task by each participant. </p>
</dd>
<dt>perceivedTime</dt>
<dd>
<p> Self reported perceived time taken to perform the task by each participant. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
