<h2>Centroid Notations for the Revised ISCC-NBS Color-Name Blocks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>CentroidsISCCNBS</code> is a table with the centroids
of the revised ISCC-NBS Color-Name Blocks, taken from <em>Kelly (1958)</em></p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This <code>data.frame</code> has 267 rows and these columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Number</dt>
<dd>
<p>ISCC-NBS number (an integer from 1 to 267)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>
<p>ISCC-NBS name</p>
</dd>
<dt>MunsellSpec</dt>
<dd>
<p>Munsell specification of the centroid of the block a (character string)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The earliest paper I am aware of is by <em>Nickerson, et. al.</em> in 1941.
After the big Munsell renotation in 1943, the name blocks were revised in 1955.
<br>
When the central colors were recomputed in
<em>Kelly (1958)</em>, they were called the "Central Colors",
though the text makes it clear that most are truly centroids,
which were computed from the centroid of an "elementary shape",
which is a "sector of a right cylindrical annulus".
For the "peripheral blocks" of high chroma, the centroids were
"estimated graphically by plotting the MacAdam limits".
<br>
In <em>Kelly (1965)</em> these were called "centroid colors",
and that is the name we will use here.
