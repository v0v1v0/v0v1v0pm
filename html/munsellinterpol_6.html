<h2>Convert Munsell Notation to numerical Munsell HVC</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert Munsell Notation to numerical Munsell HVC</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">HVCfromMunsellName( MunsellName )
MunsellHVC( MunsellName )
HueNumberFromString( HueString )
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>MunsellName</code></td>
<td>

<p>a character vector of length N &gt; 0,
where each string should be a valid Munsell notation, e.g.
<code>'2.3P 5/2.3',  '9.2YR 3/6',  'N 2.3/'</code>, and <code>'N 4/0'</code>. 
Whitespace is optional and ignored.
It is OK for a neutral to end in either <code>'/'</code> or <code>'/0'</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>HueString</code></td>
<td>

<p>a character vector of length N &gt; 0,
where each string should be the initial hue part of a Munsell notation,
e.g. '4.5GY', '2.5R', '10.3B', etc.
Whitespace is optional and ignored.
Neutrals, denoted by <code>'N'</code>, are invalid because the hue is undefined.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>HVCfromMunsellName()</code>
returns a numeric Nx3 matrix with HVC in the rows.
For neutral colors, both H and C are set to 0.
If a string cannot be parsed, the entire row is set to <code>NA</code>s.
The rownames are set to <code>MunsellName</code>.
<br><code>MunsellHVC()</code>
returns a character Nx3 matrix with HVC in the rows,
and is there for backward compatibility with older versions of the package.
For neutral colors, H is set to <code>'N'</code> and C is set to <code>'0'</code>.
<br><code>HueNumberFromString()</code> returns the hue number H (in (0,100]).
If the string cannot be parsed, or the color is neutral, the output is set to <code>NA</code>.
<br>
For all functions the Hue Number is wrapped to (0,100].
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Ever since the <em>Munsell Book of Color (1929)</em>,
the Munsell hue circle has been divided into 10 <em>principal hues</em> or arcs.
And each principal hue has been assigned a 10-point scale,
with 5 at the midpoint of the arc.
Moreover, the hue "origin" has been at '10RP'.
So a 100-point scale (with no letters) for the entire hue circle is obvious and trivial
to construct,
but I have been unable to determine the first explicit mention of such a scale.
The earliest I have have found is from <em>Nimeroff (1968)</em>,
Figures 20 and 21 on page 27.

<p>There is a reference to <em>ASTM D 1535</em> in the <b>References</b> of <em>Nimeroff</em>,
but it is not dated, and the 2 figures are not attributed to it.
There was an <em>ASTM D 1535</em> in 1968 but I have not been able to locate it;
it is possible that the 100-point scale first appeared in <em>ASTM D-1535 (1968)</em>,
or even earlier in <em>ASTM D 1525-58T (1958)</em>.
<br>
Interestingly, in the <em>Atlas of the Munsell Color System (1915)</em> there were only
5 principal hues, and each arc was assigned a 10-point scale.
If the entire hue circle of 1915 were assigned a scale, it would have been a 50-point scale.
