Data sets with forecasts and realizations
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data sets with forecasts and corresponding realizations, as used in the paper by Ehm et al (2016). In the inflation_mean data, the outcome variable is continuous; in the recession_probability
data, the outcome is binary.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(inflation_mean)
data(recession_probability)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Both data sets are data frames, with the following layout: First column contains the quarterly date, in string format (e.g. "1998Q4" for the fourth quarter of 1998). The second and third columns contain forecasts by two alternative methods. The fourth column contains realizations.</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Forecasts are generated as described in Section 4 of Ehm et al (2016).
