<h2>
<span class="pkg">music</span>: Learn and use music theory</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The music package allows you to build, play, and visualize scales, chords, and chord progression.
For playback, <span class="pkg">music</span> builds waveforms as matrices and passes them to the <span class="pkg">audio</span> package which
interfaces with the system's audio driver.
The default notation and frequencies used throughout the package are based on twelve-tone equal temperament tuning
(12ET). Custom tuning can be defined by specifying frequency ratios and a root  note. See note2freq.
A4 defaults to 440Hz, and can be changed with the 'A4' argument.
