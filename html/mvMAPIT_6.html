<h2>Multivariate MAPIT analysis of binding affinities in broadly neutralizing antibodies.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains the return object from the multivariate MAPIT method,
applied to two binding affinity traits for two broadly neutralizing antibodies.
It also contains the regression coefficients on the same data as reported by Phillips et al. (2021).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">phillips_data

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A named list containing tibble data frames:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>fisher</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tibble containing among other columns the residue id, p-values, antibody species, trait of the Phillips data. Combined p-value with Fisher's method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>harmonic</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tibble containing among other columns the residue id, p-values, antibody species, trait of the Phillips data. Combined p-value with harmonic mean p method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>regression</dt>
<dd>
<p>Named list containing two tibbles containing regression coefficients as reported by Phillips et al.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The antibody CR9114 was analyzed with influenza H1 and H3.
The antibody CR6261 was analyzed with influenza H1 and H9.
</p>
<p>In the data, the p-values are computed for the test whether a given residue
position has a marginal epistatic effect on the binding affinities.
