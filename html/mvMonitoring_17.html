<h2>A Package for Multivariate Statistical Process Monitoring</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>mvMonitoring</code> package has four main functions for
external use, all of which begin with the string "msp" (for "multivariate
statistical process") followed by the function use. Functions without this
"msp" key are primarily internal functions. They are available to see and
use, but will largely be unnecessary to call in common workflows.

<h3>
<code>mvMonitoring</code> external functions</h3>


<dl>
<dt>
<code>mspProcessData</code> - </dt>
<dd>
<p>A function for synthetic process
data generation. Use this data to test new process monitoring methods.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>mspTrain</code> - </dt>
<dd>
<p>A function to take in observations for
training under normal conditions, and to return the training summary
from these observations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>mspMonitor</code> - </dt>
<dd>
<p>A function to take in real-time
process observations and detect system anomalies based on the training
summary returned by <code>mspTrain</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>mspWarning</code> - </dt>
<dd>
<p>A function to take in observations
returned by <code>mspMonitor</code> and check for alarms by
measuring sequential anomalies. This function will also be equipped to
send SMS notifications to process technicians in future versions.
