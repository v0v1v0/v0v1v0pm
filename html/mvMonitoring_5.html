<h2>Process Data under a System Signal Amplification</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Three-feature, three-state simulated process data including
observations under normal operating conditions and observations after an
amplification of the underlying process for each feature in the system.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fault3A_xts
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An xts data matrix with 10080 rows and four columns, corresponding to
one week worth of data recorded at a 1-minute interval. The columns under
normal conditions are defined in the help file for normal_switch_xts. The
fault is a signal amplification in the underlying determining t vector. The
fault starts at row 8500, and the four columns under the fault state are
defined here:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>state : </dt>
<dd>
<p>the state indicator for the multivariate system, with three
levels</p>
</dd>
<dt>x : </dt>
<dd>
<p>x(t_*) = t_* + error</p>
</dd>
<dt>y : </dt>
<dd>
<p>y(t_*) = (t_*) ^ 2 - 3t + error</p>
</dd>
<dt>z : </dt>
<dd>
<p>z(t_*) = - (t_*) ^ 3 + 3(t_*) ^ 2 + error</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>where t_* = 3 * t * (10080 - s) / (2 * 10080), where s is the observation
index, and t is a 10080-entry vector of autocorrelated and non-stationary
hidden process realizations. The states alternate each hour and are defined
as follows:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>State1 – </dt>
<dd>
<p>As presented</p>
</dd>
<dt>State2 – </dt>
<dd>
<p>Rotated by (yaw = 0, pitch = 90, roll = 30) and scaled by
(1 * x, 0.5 * y , 2 * z).</p>
</dd>
<dt>State3 – </dt>
<dd>
<p>Rotated by (yaw = 90, pitch = 0, roll = -30) and scaled by
(0.25 * x, 0.1 * y , 0.75 * z).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>See the vignette for more details.
