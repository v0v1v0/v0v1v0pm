<h2>
Wrapper function to find best (out of BM, OU, OUOU, OUBM) fitting evolutionary model and 
estimate its parameters.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>estimate.evolutionary.model</code> function calls the
<code>BrownianMotionModel</code>,  <code>ouchModel</code> and <code>mvslouchModel</code>
functions with different classes of evolutionary model parameters.
It then compares the resulting estimates by the AICc (or BIC if AICc fails) and 
returns the best overall model. The user is recommended to install the suggested package 
<span class="pkg">PCMBaseCpp</span> which significantly speeds up the calculations (see Details).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">estimate.evolutionary.model(phyltree, mData, regimes = NULL, 
root.regime = NULL, M.error = NULL, repeats = 5, model.setups = NULL, 
predictors = NULL, kY = NULL, doPrint = FALSE, pESS=NULL, 
estimate.root.state=FALSE, min_bl = 0.0003, maxiter=c(10,50,100))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>phyltree</code></td>
<td>

<p>The phylogeny in <code>phylo</code> format. The tree can be obtained from e.g. a <code>nexus</code> file 
by the <code>read.nexus()</code> function from the <span class="pkg">ape</span> package. The "standard" <span class="pkg">ape</span> node
indexing is assumed: for a tree with <code class="reqn">n</code> tips, the tips should have indices <code>1:n</code> 
and the root index <code>n+1</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mData</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix with the rows corresponding to the tip species while the columns correspond to the traits.
The rows should be named by species <br> (field <code>phyltree$tip.label</code>), if not, then a warning
is thrown and the order of the species is assumed to be the same as the order in which the 
species are in the phylogeny (i.e. correspond to the node indices <code>1:n</code>, 
where <code class="reqn">n</code> is the number of tips). The columns should be named by traits, otherwise
a warning is thrown and generic names are generated.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>regimes</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector or list of regimes. If vector then each entry corresponds to each of <code>phyltree</code>'s
branches, i.e. to each row of <code>phyltree$edge</code>.If list then each list entry corresponds to a tip node
and is a vector for regimes on that lineage. If <code>NULL</code>, then a constant regime is assumed on
the whole tree.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>root.regime</code></td>
<td>

<p>The regime at the root of the tree. If not given, then it is taken as the regime that is present
on the root's daughter lineages and is the most frequent one in the <code>regimes</code> vector. If more
than one regime has the same maximum frequency, then alphabetically first one of the maximum ones
is taken.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>M.error</code></td>
<td>

<p>An optional measurement error covariance structure. The measurement errors between species are assumed 
independent. The program tries to recognize the structure of the passed matrix and accepts the following 
possibilities :
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>a single number that is a common measurement error for all tips and species,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a m element vector with each value corresponding to a variable, measurement errors are independent
between variables and each species is assumed to have the same measurement errors,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a m x m ((number of variables) x (number of variables)) matrix, all species will
have the same measurement error,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a list of length n (number of species), each list element is the covariance structure 
for the appropriate (numbering according to tree) species, either a single number 
(each variable has same variance), vector (of length m for each variable), or m x m matrix, 
the order of the list has to correspond to the order of the nodes in the <code>phyltree</code> object,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NULL no measurement error.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From version <code>2.0.0</code> of <span class="pkg">mvSLOUCH</span> it is impossible to pass a single joint measurement error matrix 
for all the species and traits. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>repeats</code></td>
<td>

<p>How many starting points for the numerical maximum likelihood procedure should be tried for 
each model setup. On the first repeat for OUOU and OUBM modes the functions takes as the starting
point (for <code>A</code> and <code>Syy</code>) values based on the sample covariance matrix estimate, 
motivated by Bartoszek <code class="reqn">\&amp;</code> Sagitov (2015)'s univariate results.

(but simulations concerning this are not conclusive) slightly detrimental to the optimization process 
if <code>Atype</code> is <code>"DecomposablePositive"</code>, <code>"DecomposableNegative"</code>, or
<code>"DecomposableReal"</code>. In these cases <code>A</code> is parametrized by its eigendecomposition.
Additional exponentiation of the diagonal, to ensure positivity, could (but this is uncertain)
make the exploration of the likelihood surface more difficult. The user is advised to
also try <code>diag=NULL</code>. In the case of <code>Atype</code> being <code>"SymmetricPositiveDefinite"</code>,
the diagonal is always guaranteed to be positive.

Furthermore, <span class="pkg">mvSLOUCH</span> sets all branches in the tree shorter than <code>min_bl</code> to <code>min_bl</code>.

initial state are estimated by a phylogenetic GLS procedure. After this the other (except of <code>B</code> 
in OUBM model case) parameters are optimized over by <code>optim()</code>. This first
entry controls the number of iterations of this procedure.   The second is the number of iterations inside
the iterated GLS for the OUBM model. In the first step regime optima and <code>B</code> (and perhaps initial state) 
are estimated conditional on the other parameters and current estimate of <code>B</code>, then the estimate of <code>B</code>
is update and the same phylogenetic GLS is repeated (second entry of <code>maxiter</code> number of times).

in the Brownian motion and measurement error case.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The likelihood calculations are done by the <span class="pkg">PCMBase</span> package. However, there is a
C++ backend, <span class="pkg">PCMBaseCpp</span>. If it is not available, then the likelihood is calculated
slower using pure R. However, with the calculations in C++ up to a 100-fold increase in
speed is possible (more realistically 10-20 times). The <span class="pkg">PCMBaseCpp</span> package is available
from <a href="https://github.com/venelin/PCMBaseCpp">https://github.com/venelin/PCMBaseCpp</a>.
</p>
<p>The setting <code>Atype="Any"</code> means that one assumes the matrix <code>A</code> is eigendecomposable.
If the estimation algorithm hits a defective <code>A</code>, then it sets the log-likelihood at
the minimum value and will try to get out of this dip.
</p>
<p>If <code>model.setups</code> is left at the default value the 
function will take a long time to run, as it performs estimation for each model 
(<code>generate.model.setups</code> generates 90 setups) times the value in repeats. 
Therefore if the user has particular hypotheses in mind then it is advisable to
prepare their own list.
If the <code>Syy</code> matrix is assumed to be upper-triangular and the starting conditions
based on Bartoszek <code class="reqn">\&amp;</code> Sagitov (2015)'s results are used then the factorization
of <code class="reqn">\Sigma=\Sigma_{yy} \Sigma_{yy}^{T}</code> into <code class="reqn">\Sigma_{yy}</code> is 
done using the procedure described in 
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2039477/cholesky-decompostion-upper-triangular-or-lower-triangular">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2039477/cholesky-decompostion-upper-triangular-or-lower-triangular</a>.
</p>
<p>From version <code>2.0.0</code> of <span class="pkg">mvSLOUCH</span> the data has to be passed as a matrix.
To underline this the data parameter's name has been changed to <code>mData</code>. 
</p>
<p>If AICc fails, then the function will use BIC to select between models. This is extremely 
unlikely essentially only when AICc is infinite, i.e. the model is saturated 
(number of observations equals number of data points).
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The engine behind the likelihood calculations is called from <span class="pkg">PCMBase</span>.
The <code>slouch</code> package is a recommended alternative if one has a OUBM models and 
only a single response (Y) trait. 
The <code>mvMORPH</code>, <code>ouch</code> and <code>Rphylpars</code> packages consider multivariate OU models 
and looking at them could be helpful.

### We will first simulate a small phylogenetic tree using functions from ape.
### For simulating the tree one could also use alternative functions, e.g. sim.bd.taxa 
### from the TreeSim package
phyltree&lt;-ape::rtree(4)

## The line below is not necessary but advisable for speed
phyltree&lt;-phyltree_paths(phyltree)

### Define a vector of regimes.
regimes&lt;-c("small","small","large","small","large","small")

### Define SDE parameters to be able to simulate data under the OUOU model.
OUOUparameters&lt;-list(vY0=matrix(c(1,-1,0.5),nrow=3,ncol=1),
A=rbind(c(9,0,0),c(0,5,0),c(0,0,1)),mPsi=cbind("small"=c(1,-1,0.5),"large"=c(-1,1,0.5)),
Syy=rbind(c(1,0.25,0.3),c(0,1,0.2),c(0,0,1)))

### Now simulate the data.
OUOUdata&lt;-simulOUCHProcPhylTree(phyltree,OUOUparameters,regimes,NULL)
OUOUdata&lt;-OUOUdata[phyltree$tip.label,,drop=FALSE]

## set up for a trivial, single model setup case (for running time)
## in a real analysis you should carefully choose between what models
## you want to do model selection
model_setups&lt;-list(list(evolmodel="bm"))

### Try to recover the parameters of the OUOU model.
### maxiter here set to minimal working possibility, in reality it should be larger
### e.g. default of c(10,50,100)
estimResults&lt;-estimate.evolutionary.model(phyltree,OUOUdata,regimes=regimes,
root.regime="small",M.error=NULL,repeats=1,model.setups=model_setups,predictors=c(3),
kY=2,doPrint=TRUE,pESS=NULL,maxiter=c(1,1,1))

### After this step you can look at the best estimated model and use the
### parametric.bootstrap() function to obtain bootstrap confidence intervals
RNGversion(as.character(getRversion()))

## Not run:  ##It takes too long to run this
## take a less trivial setup
phyltree&lt;-ape::rtree(5)

## The line below is not necessary but advisable for speed

### Define SDE parameters to be able to simulate data under the OUOU model.
OUOUparameters&lt;-list(vY0=matrix(c(1,-1,0.5),nrow=3,ncol=1),
A=rbind(c(9,0,0),c(0,5,0),c(0,0,1)),mPsi=cbind("small"=c(1,-1,0.5),"large"=c(-1,1,0.5)),
Syy=rbind(c(1,0.25,0.3),c(0,1,0.2),c(0,0,1)))

### Now simulate the data.
OUOUdata&lt;-simulOUCHProcPhylTree(phyltree,OUOUparameters,regimes,NULL)
OUOUdata&lt;-OUOUdata[phyltree$tip.label,,drop=FALSE]

## set up for two very simple (for example usage) models to compare between
## in a real analysis you should carefully choose between what models
## you want to do model selection, the default 
## model_setups&lt;-NULL provides a wide selection of models

model_setups&lt;-list(list(evolmodel="bm"),list(evolmodel="ouch",
"Atype"="SingleValueDiagonal","Syytype"="SingleValueDiagonal","diagA"="Positive"))

### Try to recover the parameters of the OUOU model.
estimResults&lt;-estimate.evolutionary.model(phyltree,OUOUdata,regimes=regimes,
root.regime="small",M.error=NULL,repeats=3,model.setups=model_setups,predictors=c(3),
kY=2,doPrint=TRUE,pESS=NULL,maxiter=c(10,50,100))
