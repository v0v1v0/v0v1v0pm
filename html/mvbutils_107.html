<h2>Auto-create a NAMESPACE file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Called by <code>pre.install</code> for would-be packages that have a <code>.onLoad</code> function, and are therefore assumed to want a namespace. Produces defaults for the import, export, and S3Methods. You can modify this information prior to the NAMESPACE file being created, using the pre-install hook mechanism. The default for <code>import</code> is taken from the DESCRIPTION file, but the defaults for export and S3 methods are deduced from your functions, and are described below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Don't call this directly-- pre.install will do it automatically for you
make.NAMESPACE( env=1, path=attr( env, "path"),
  description=read.dcf( file.path( path, "DESCRIPTION"))[1,], more.exports=character( 0))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> env</code></td>
<td>
<p>character or numeric position on search path</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> path</code></td>
<td>
<p>directory where proto-package lives</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> description</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) elements for the DESCRIPTION file, e.g. <code>c( ..., Author="R.A. Fisher", ...)</code>. By default, read from existing file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> more.exports</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) things to export that normally wouldn't be.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There is (currently) no attempt to handle S4 methods.
</p>
<p>The imported packages are those listed in the "Depends:" and "Imports:" field of the DESCRIPTION file. At present, all functions in those packages will be imported (i.e. no "importFrom" provision).
</p>
<p>The exported functions are all those in <code>find.documented(doctype="any")</code> unless they appear to be S3 methods, plus any functions that have a non-NULL <code>export.me</code> attribute. The latter is a cheap way of arranging for a function to be exported, but without formal documentation (is that wise??). <code>pre.install</code> will incorporate any undocumented <code>export.me</code> functions in the "mypack-internal.Rd" file, so that RCMD CHECK will be happy.
</p>
<p>The S3 methods are all the functions whose names start "&lt;&lt;generic&gt;&gt;." and whose first argument has the same name as in the appropriate <code>&lt;&lt;generic&gt;&gt;</code>. The generics that are checked are (i) the names of the character vector <code>.knownS3Generics</code> in package <span class="pkg">base</span>; (ii) all functions that look like generics in any importees or dependees of your would-be package (i.e. functions in the namespace whose name is a prefix of a function in the S3 methods table of the namespace, and whose body contains a call to <code>UseMethod</code>); (iii) any plausible-looking generic in your would-be package (effectively the same criterion). Documented functions which look like methods but whose flat-doc documentation names them explicitly in the <b>Usage</b> section (e.g. referring to <code>print.myclass(...)</code> rather than just <code>print(...)</code>, the latter being how you're supposed to document methods) are assumed not be methods.
