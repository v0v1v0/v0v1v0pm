<h2>Convert existing source package into task package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts an existing source package into a task package. A subdirectory with the package name will be created under the current working directory, and will be populated with a ".RData" file and various other files/directories from the source package. All Rd files will be turned into flat-format help in the ".RData", either attached to functions or as stand-alone "*.doc" text objects, as per <code>help2flatdoc</code>. The subdirectory will also be made into a <em>task</em>, i.e. it will be added to the "tasks" vector in the current workspace that <code>cd</code> uses to keep track of the task hierarchy.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">unpackage(spath, force = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> spath</code></td>
<td>
<p>where to find the source package</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> force</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, overwrite any previous contents of task package without prompting.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The NAMESPACE file won't be copied; instead, it will be auto-generated by <code>pre.install</code>. Therefore, some features of the original NAMESPACE may be lost. You can either copy the NAMESPACE manually (in which case, you'll need to maintain it by hand), or write a "pre.install.hook.MYPACK" function.
</p>
<p>The DESCRIPTION file becomes a character vector called e.g. <code>&lt;mypack&gt;.DESCRIPTION</code>, of class "cat" (see <code>as.cat</code>).
</p>
<p>Functions in the ".RData" may be saved with extra attributes, in particular "doc" (deduced from a dot-Rd file) but perhaps other things too that they acquire after the package code is <code>source</code>d. Attributes that are character vector will acquire class "docattr", so that they won't be fully displayed during default printing of the function; to see them, use e.g. <code>as.cat( attr( myfun, "myatt"))</code> or <code>unclass( attr( myfun, "myatt"))</code> or, if you are using the <span class="pkg">atease</span> package, just <code>as.cat( myfun@myatt)</code>. Editing the function with <code>fixr</code> will display the character attributes in full.
</p>
<p>Any environment objects found in the package's environment (its namespace environment) will be dropped from the ".RData" file, with a warning; this is to avoid dramas on reloading.
