<h2>The R help system</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>?x</code> is the usual way to get help on <code>x</code>; it's primarily a shortcut for <code>help(x)</code>. There are rarer but more flexible variations, such as <code>x?y</code> or <code>help(x,...)</code>. See base-R help on help. The versions of <code>help</code> and <code>?</code> exported by <code>mvbutils</code> behave exactly the same as base-R, unless base-R <code>help</code> <em>fails</em> after being called with a single argument, e.g. <code>help(topic)</code>. In that case, if <code>topic</code> is an object with an attribute called "doc" (or failing that if <code>topic</code> or <code>topic.doc</code> is a character vector), then the attribute (or the character object) will be formatted and displayed by the pager (by default) or browser. This lets you write informal documentation for non-package objects that can still be found by <code>help</code>, and by colleagues you distribute your code to. See <code>dochelp</code> for more information. The rest of this documentation is copied directly from base-R for <code>help</code>, except as noted under <b>Arguments</b> for <code>help_type</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">help(topic, package = NULL, lib.loc = NULL,
     verbose = getOption("verbose"),
     try.all.packages = getOption("help.try.all.packages"),
     help_type = getOption("help_type"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> topic</code></td>
<td>
<p>usually, a name or character string specifying the topic for which help is sought. A character string (enclosed in explicit single or double quotes) is always taken as naming a topic. If the value of <code>topic</code> is a length-one character vector the topic is taken to be the value of the only element. Otherwise <code>topic</code> must be a name or a reserved word (if syntactically valid) or character string. See <b>Details</b> for what happens if this is omitted.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> package</code></td>
<td>
<p>a name or character vector giving the packages to look into for documentation, or <code>NULL</code>. By default, all packages in the search path are used. To avoid a name being deparsed use e.g. <code>(pkg_ref)</code> (see the examples).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> lib.loc</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector of directory names of R libraries, or <code>NULL</code>. The default value of <code>NULL</code> corresponds to all libraries currently known. If the default is used, the loaded packages are searched before the libraries. This is not used for HTML help (see <b>Details</b>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical; if <code>TRUE</code>, the file name is reported.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> try.all.packages</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical; see <b>Note</b>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> help_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string:the type of help required. Possible values are "text", "html" and "pdf". Case is ignored, and partial matching is allowed. [Note that, for informal doco, <code>getOption( mvb_help_type, "text")</code> is used; i.e., the default there is always the pager, which lets you be as informal as you please.]</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following types of help are available:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Plain text help
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> HTML help pages with hyperlinks to other topics, shown in a browser by <code>browseURL</code>. If for some reason HTML help is unavailable (see <code>startDynamicHelp</code>), plain text help will be used instead.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For <code>help</code> only, typeset as PDF - see the section on <b>Offline help</b>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The default for the type of help is selected when R is installed - the <code>factory-fresh</code> default is HTML help.
</p>
<p>The rendering of text help will use directional quotes in suitable locales (UTF-8 and single-byte Windows locales): sometimes the fonts used do not support these quotes so this can be turned off by setting <code>options(useFancyQuotes = FALSE)</code>.
</p>
<p><code>topic</code> is not optional. If it is omitted, R will give:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> If a package is specified, (text or, in interactive use only, HTML) information on the package, including hints/links to suitable help topics.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If <code>lib.loc</code> only is specified, a (text) list of available packages.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Help on <code>help</code> itself if none of the first three arguments is specified.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some topics need to be quoted (by backticks) or given as a character string. These include those which cannot syntactically appear on their own such as unary and binary operators, <code>function</code> and control-flow reserved words (including <code>if</code>, <code>else</code> <code>for</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>repeat</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>break</code> and <code>next</code>). The other <code>reserved</code> words can be used as if they were names, for example <code>TRUE</code>, <code>NA</code> and <code>Inf</code>.
</p>
<p>If multiple help files matching <code>topic</code> are found, in interactive use a menu is presented for the user to choose one: in batch use the first on the search path is used. (For HTML help the menu will be an HTML page, otherwise a graphical menu if possible if <code>getOption("menu.graphics")</code> is true, the default.)
</p>
<p>Note that HTML help does not make use of <code>lib.loc</code>: it will always look first in the attached packages and then along <code>libPaths()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Offline help</h3>

<p>Typeset documentation is produced by running the LaTeX version of the help page through <code>pdflatex</code>: this will produce a PDF file.
</p>
<p>The appearance of the output can be customized through a file <code>Rhelp.cfg</code> somewhere in your LaTeX search path: this will be input as a LaTeX style file after <code>Rd.sty</code>. Some environment variables are consulted, notably <code>R_PAPERSIZE</code> (<em>via</em> <code>getOption("papersize")</code>) and <code>R_RD4PDF</code> (see <code>Making manuals</code> in the <code>R Installation and Administration Manual</code>).
</p>
<p>If there is a function <code>offline_help_helper</code> in the workspace or further down the search path it is used to do the typesetting, otherwise the function of that name in the <code>utils</code> namespace (to which the first paragraph applies). It should accept at least two arguments, the name of the LaTeX file to be typeset and the type (which as from R 2.15.0 is ignored). As from R 2.14.0 it should accept a third argument, <code>texinputs</code>, which will give the graphics path when the help document contains figures, and will otherwise not be supplied.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Unless <code>lib.loc</code> is specified explicitly, the loaded packages are searched before those in the specified libraries. This ensures that if a library is loaded from a library not in the known library trees, then the help from the loaded library is used. If <code>lib.loc</code> is specified explicitly, the loaded packages are <em>not</em> searched.
</p>
<p>If this search fails and argument <code>try.all.packages</code> is <code>TRUE</code> and neither <code>packages</code> nor <code>lib.loc</code> is specified, then all the packages in the known library trees are searched for help on <code>topic</code> and a list of (any) packages where help may be found is displayed (with hyperlinks for <code>help_type = "html"</code>). <b>NB:</b> searching all packages can be slow, especially the first time (caching of files by the OS can expedite subsequent searches dramatically).
