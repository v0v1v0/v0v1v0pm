<h2>Check consistency of maintained package versions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Utility to compare version numbers of the different "instances" of one of your maintained packages. Only the most up-to-date folders relevant to the running R version are checked; see <code>mvbutils.packaging.tools</code>.
</p>
<p>The "instances" checked are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> the task package itself (in eg <code>..mypack$mypack.VERSION</code>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the source package created by <code>pre.install</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the installed package, maintained by <code>patch.install</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the tarball package, created by <code>build.pkg</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the binary package, created by <code>build.pkg.binary</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>care</code> argument controls what's shown. Mismatches when <code>care="installed"</code> should be addressed by <code>patch.install</code>, because something has gotten out-of-synch (probably when maintaining the same version of a package for different R versions). Mismatches with the built ("tarball" and "binary") packages are not necessarily a problem, just an indication of work-in-progress.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">check.patch.versions(care = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code> care</code></td>
<td>
<p>if non-NULL, a character vector with elements in the set "installed", "source", "tarball", and "binary". Only packages where there's a version mismatch between these fields and the task package version will be shown.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A character matrix with maintained packages as rows, and the different instances as columns. "NA" indicates that a version couldn't be found.
</p>
