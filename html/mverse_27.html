<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset was collected by Jung et al. in their study
<em>Female hurricanes are deadlier than male hurricanes</em>.
Their study didn't include hurricanes Katrina and Audrey which were
deemed as outliers. Simonsohn et al. collected the extra data for
doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-0912-z">10.1038/s41562-020-0912-z</a>Specification curve analysis
including an additional femininity index based on an MTUrk survey
and updated normalized damage amount in 2015 U.S. dollars.
</p>
<p>This dataset includes data prepared by Jung et al. (2014) as well as those
prepared by Simonsohn et al. (2020). Specifically, all data on Katrina and
Audrey are from Simonsohn et al. (2020) except minimum pressure updated
in 2014. They were retrieved from
<a href="https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/All_U.S._Hurricanes.html">
Continental United States Hurricane Impacts/Landfalls 1851-2021</a> table
maintained by U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Maximum wind speed, femininity index from MTUrk survey, and
2015 damage amounts are also from Simonsohn et al. (2020).
