<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>eval_mvgam</code> may be useful when both repeated fitting of a model using <code>update.mvgam</code>
for exact leave-future-out cross-validation and approximate
leave-future-out cross-validation using <code>lfo_cv</code> are impractical. The function generates a set of samples representing fixed parameters estimated from the full
<code>mvgam</code> model and latent trend states at a given point in time. The trends are rolled forward
a total of <code>fc_horizon</code> timesteps according to their estimated state space dynamics to
generate an 'out-of-sample' forecast that is evaluated against the true observations in the horizon window.
This function therefore simulates a situation where the model's parameters had already been estimated but
we have only observed data up to the evaluation timepoint and would like to generate forecasts from the
latent trends that have been observed up to that timepoint. Evaluation involves calculating an
appropriate Rank Probability Score and a binary indicator
for whether or not the true value lies within the forecast's 90% prediction interval
</p>
<p><code>roll_eval_mvgam</code> sets up a sequence of evaluation timepoints along a rolling window and iteratively
calls <code>eval_mvgam</code> to evaluate 'out-of-sample' forecasts.
Evaluation involves calculating the Rank Probability Scores and a binary indicator
for whether or not the true value lies within the forecast's 90% prediction interval
</p>
<p><code>compare_mvgams</code> automates the evaluation to compare two fitted models using rolling window forecast evaluation and
provides a series of summary plots to facilitate model selection. It is essentially a wrapper for
<code>roll_eval_mvgam</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>eval_mvgam</code>, a <code>list</code> object containing information on specific evaluations for each series
(if using <code>drps</code> or <code>crps</code> as the score) or a vector of scores when using <code>variogram</code>.
</p>
<p>For <code>roll_eval_mvgam</code>, a <code>list</code> object containing information on specific evaluations for each series as well as
a total evaluation summary (taken by summing the forecast score for each series at each evaluation and averaging
the coverages at each evaluation)
</p>
<p>For <code>compare_mvgams</code>, a series of plots comparing forecast Rank Probability Scores for each competing
model. A lower score is preferred. Note however that it is possible to select a model that ultimately
would perform poorly in true out-of-sample forecasting. For example if a wiggly smooth function of 'year'
is included in the model then this function will be learned prior to evaluating rolling window forecasts,
and the model could generate very tight predictions as a result. But when forecasting ahead to timepoints
that the model has not seen (i.e. next year), the smooth function will end up extrapolating, sometimes
in very strange and unexpected ways. It is therefore recommended to only use smooth functions for
covariates that are adequately measured in the data (i.e. 'seasonality', for example) to reduce possible
extrapolation of smooths and let the latent trends in the <code>mvgam</code> model capture any
temporal dependencies in the data. These trends are time series models and so will provide much more
stable forecasts
