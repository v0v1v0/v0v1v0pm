<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extract the LOOIC (leave-one-out information criterion) using
<code>loo::loo()</code>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'mvgam'

## S3 method for class 'mvgam'

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Object of class <code>mvgam</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>incl_dynamics</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical; indicates if any latent dynamic structures that
were included in the model should be considered when calculating in-sample
log-likelihoods. Defaults to <code>TRUE</code></p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When comparing two (or more) fitted <code>mvgam</code> models, we can estimate the
difference in their in-sample predictive accuracies using the Expcted Log Predictive
Density (ELPD). This metric can be approximated using Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling, which
is a method to re-weight posterior draws to approximate what predictions the models might have
made for a given datapoint had that datapoint not been included in the original model fit (i.e.
if we were to run a leave-one-out cross-validation and then made a prediction for the held-out
datapoint). See details from <code>loo::loo()</code> and <code>loo::loo_compare()</code> for further information
on how this importance sampling works.
</p>
<p>There are two fundamentally different ways to calculate ELPD from <code>mvgam</code> models that included
dynamic latent processes (i.e. "trend_models"). The first is to use the predictions that were
generated when estimating these latent processes by setting <code>incl_dynamics = TRUE</code>. This works
in the same way that setting <code>incl_autocor = TRUE</code> in <code>brms::prepare_predictions()</code>. But it may
also be desirable to compare predictions by considering that the dynamic processes are nuisance
parameters that we'd wish to account for when making inferences about other processes in the
model (i.e. the linear predictor effects). Setting <code>incl_dynamics = FALSE</code> will accomplish
this by ignoring the dynamic processes when making predictions. This option matches up with
what <code>mvgam</code>'s prediction functions return (i.e. <code>predict.mvgam</code>, <code>ppc</code>,
<code>pp_check.mvgam</code>, <code>posterior_epred.mvgam</code>) and will be far less forgiving
of models that may be overfitting the training data due to highly flexible dynamic processes
(such as Random Walks, for example). However setting <code>incl_dynamics = FALSE</code> will often result
in less stable Pareto k diagnostics for models with dynamic trends, making ELPD comparisons
difficult and unstable. It is therefore recommended to generally stick with
<code>incl_dynamics = TRUE</code> when comparing models based on in-sample fits, and then to perhaps use
forecast evaluations for further scrutiny of models (see for example <code>forecast.mvgam</code>,
<code>score.mvgam_forecast</code> and <code>lfo_cv</code>)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>for <code>loo.mvgam</code>, an object of class <code>psis_loo</code> (see <code>loo::loo()</code>
for details). For <code>loo_compare.mvgam</code>, an object of class <code>compare.loo</code> (
<code>loo::loo_compare()</code> for details)
</p>
