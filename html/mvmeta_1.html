Multivariate and Univariate Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package <span class="pkg">mvmeta</span> consists of a collection of functions to perform fixed and random-effects multivariate and univariate meta-analysis and meta-regression in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>.
</p>
<p>It is now superseded by the package <span class="pkg">mixmeta</span>, which offers a unified mixed-effects framework to perform various meta-analytical models in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>, including non-standard extensions such as multivariate, multilevel, longitudinal, and dose-response models. The package <span class="pkg">mvmeta</span> will be still maintained, but its development is now discontinued. Improvements and further extensions will be implemented in <span class="pkg">mixmeta</span>. Users are suggested to switch to the latter.
</p>


<h3>Modelling framework</h3>

<p>Multivariate meta-analytical models represent an extension of the standard univariate techniques, where estimates of a single effect size, here defined generally as outcome, are pooled across studies. In multivariate meta-analysis, estimates of multiple outcomes are combined while accounting for their correlation. Multivariate meta-regression also models such multivariate distribution in terms of study-level predictors. These statistical tools were originally proposed to model multiple endpoints in clinical trials. Applications and methodological developments are currently proposed also for network meta-analysis (indirect treatment comparison), for the meta-analysis of multi-parameter associations and for meta-analysis of diagnostic studies, among others. See references below for details.
</p>
<p>Similarly to univariate methods, fixed-effects models do not assume heterogeneity among studies, and the estimates are conditional on the set of studies collected in the meta-analysis, based on a multivariate weighted average of study-level estimates. Random-effects meta-analysis, instead, allows a degree of heterogeneity among studies, assuming the (true but unobserved) study-specific outcomes as randomly sampled from a multivariate normal distribution of studies. Inference from these models may therefore be extended to other unmeasured studies assumed to belong to the same (usually hypothetical) population.
</p>
<p>Estimation and interpretation exploit here the framework of linear mixed models. The fixed part of the model provides an estimate of fixed effects, which represent the population-averaged outcomes and, in the case of meta-regression, are defined by a set of coefficients associated to study-level predictors. The random part of the model describes the deviation from the population averages, estimating the components of a between-study (co)variance matrix. Assuming <code class="reqn">k</code> outcomes <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{y}_i</code> estimated in each of <code class="reqn">i = 1, \ldots, m</code> studies, and related to <code class="reqn">p</code> study-level predictors <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{x}_i</code>, random-effects multivariate meta-regression models can be generally described with:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{y}_i \sim \mbox{N}_k(\boldsymbol{X}_i \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{S}_i + \Psi)</code>
</p>

<p>Here the outcomes <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{y}_i</code> are assumed to be sampled from a multivariate normal distribution of order <code class="reqn">k</code>. Their distribution is centred on <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{X}_i \boldsymbol{\beta}</code>, with <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{X}_i</code> as a <code class="reqn">k \times kp</code> design matrix and <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\beta}</code> the vector of fixed-effects coefficients. The marginal <code class="reqn">k \times k</code> (co)variance matrix <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_i = \boldsymbol{S}_i + \boldsymbol{\Psi}</code> is given by the sum of within (assumed known) and between-study (co)variance matrices <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{S}_i</code> and <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\Psi}</code>, respectively.
</p>
<p>Other models are taken as special cases of that above. In multivariate meta-analysis, <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{X}_i</code> becomes an identity matrix with <code class="reqn">p=1</code>, and <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\beta}</code> reduces to <code class="reqn">k</code> intercepts, interpreted as the population-averaged outcomes. For <code class="reqn">k=1</code>, the model reduces to the standard univariate meta-analysis or meta-regression. In fixed-effects meta-analytic models, <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\Psi}</code> is assumed not to exist, and the variability between studies is due exclusively to the within-study estimation error.
</p>


<h3>Estimation methods</h3>

<p>The aim is to estimate the coefficients <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\beta}</code> and, for random-effects models, the components of the between-study (co)variance matrix <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\Psi}</code>. If the same linear predictor of <code class="reqn">p</code> terms <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{x}_i</code> measured in each study is specified for all the outcomes (the only option available in the current version), the dimension of <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\beta}</code> is <code class="reqn">kp</code>. The parameters for the random part depend on the chosen structure of the between-study (co)variance matrix <code class="reqn">\boldsymbol{\Psi}</code>, with <code class="reqn">k(k+1)/2</code> parameters for an unstructured form, and a smaller set of parameters for structured (co)variances. 
</p>
<p>Different estimator are implemented in the package <span class="pkg">mvmeta</span>. The estimation options available in the current version are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><b>Fixed-effects</b>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Maximum likelihood</b> (ML)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Restricted maximum likelihood</b> (REML)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Method of moments</b>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b>Variance components</b>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fixed-effects model is fitted through generalized least squares (GLS), assuming the (co)variance structure, composed by the within-study error only, as completely known. Among random-effects models, ML and REML approaches provides fit criteria and inferential test derived from likelihood theory, such as AIC and likelihood ratio test. However, they are based on computationally intensive iterative procedures of optimization, and convergence can be slow for high-dimensional models (with a high number of outcomes). Estimators based on semiparametric alternatives such as the non-iterative method of moments or the iterative variance components approach are generally faster. Further details on estimation methods are given in the related help pages.

<h3>Functions and data included in the package</h3>

<p>The main function in the package is <code>mvmeta</code>, which performs the various models illustrated above. This function resembles standard regression functions in <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>, and specifies the model through a regression formula. The function returns a list object of class <code>"mvmeta"</code> (see <code>mvmetaObject</code>).
</p>
<p>The estimation is carried out internally through <code>mvmeta.fit</code>, a wrapper which prepares the data and calls specific estimation functions for fitting the models. Specifically, <code>mvmeta.fixed</code> is applied for fixed-effects models, while estimators for random-effects models are implemented in the functions <code>mvmeta.ml</code> and <code>mvmeta.reml</code> for (restricted) maximum likelihood, <code>mvmeta.mm</code> for the method of moments, and <code>mvmeta.vc</code> for variance components. For likelihood-based methods, iterative <code>optimizations algorithms</code> are used for maximizing the (restricted) likelihood, and specific <code>(co)variance structures</code> for the between-study random effects are available. Fitting parameter options are set by <code>mvmeta.control</code>.
</p>
<p>Method functions are available for objects of class <code>"mvmeta"</code> (see <code>mvmetaObject</code> for a complete list). The method <code>summary</code> produces a list of class <code>"summary.mvmeta"</code> for summarizing the fit of the model and providing additional results. The method function <code>predict</code> computes predicted values, optionally for a set of new values of the predictors. <code>blup</code> gives the (empirical) best linear unbiased predictions for the set of studies used for estimation. Other default or specific method functions for regression can be used on objects of class <code>"mvmeta"</code>, such as <code>fitted</code> and <code>residuals</code>, <code>logLik</code>, <code>AIC</code> and <code>BIC</code>, among others.
</p>
<p>Methods for <code>model.frame</code> and <code>model.matrix</code> are used to extract and construct the model frame and the design matrix of the regression meta-analytical model, respectively. Methods for <code>na.omit</code> and <code>na.exclude</code> help handle correctly missing values.
</p>
<p>Simulations can be produced using the function <code>mvmetaSim</code> and the method function <code>simulate</code>, which return one or multiple sets of simulated outcomes for a group of studies. The function <code>inputna</code> and <code>inputcov</code> are used internally to augment the missing data values and to input missing correlations, respectively.
</p>
<p>The method function <code>qtest.mvmeta</code> (producing an object with class of the same name) performs the (multivariate) Cochran Q test for (residual) heterogeneity, both on the overall multivariate distribution and on each single outcome. The generic method function is <code>qtest</code>.
</p>
<p>Printing functions for the objects of classes defined above are also provided. Other functions are used internally in the source code, and not exported in the namespace. For users interested in getting into details of the package structure, these functions can be displayed using the triple colon ('<code>:::</code>') operator. For instance, <code>mvmeta:::glsfit</code> displays the code of the function <code>glsfit</code>. Also, some comments are added in the original source code.
</p>
<p>The package includes the datasets <code>berkey98</code>, <code>fibrinogen</code>, <code>hsls</code>, <code>hyp</code>, <code>p53</code> and <code>smoking</code> as data frames, which are used in the examples.

<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>This release of the package <span class="pkg">mvmeta</span> has been tested with different simulated and real datasets. The functions generally perform well under several scenarios, and comparisons with alternative software implementations show good agreement. However, bugs and bad performance under un-tested conditions may not be excluded. Please report any error or unexpected behaviour to the e-mail address below.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The functions included in the package <span class="pkg">mvmeta</span> may be applied also to perform standard univariate meta-analysis and meta-regression. However, alternative packages provides a more exhaustive and efficient set of functions. See for example the packages <span class="pkg">metafor</span>, <span class="pkg">meta</span>, <span class="pkg">rmeta</span> and <span class="pkg">metaLik</span>, among others.
</p>
<p>Functions for fitting multivariate models are available in other <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> packages. The package <span class="pkg">metafor</span> provides functions to perform fixed or random-effects multivariate models, the latter fitted through maximum or restricted maximum likelihood. A thorough comparison with the implementation offered in <span class="pkg">mvmeta</span> is not available yet. The package <span class="pkg">metaSEM</span> (not in CRAN) offers functions to perfor fixed-effects and likelihood-based random-effects multivariate meta-analysis through structural equation modelling. The package <span class="pkg">mvtmeta</span> performs fixed-effects and random-effects multivariate meta-analysis using the same method of moments estimator adopted here, although without allowing for missing outcomes or meta-regression. The package <span class="pkg">mada</span> contains functions for bivariate models used in diagnostic studies.
