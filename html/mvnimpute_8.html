<h2>Combined NHANES dataset from 1999-2004 NHANES study</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset including the age, gender and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index and 24 PCB
measurements.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NHANES.dat
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list including data frame with 5874 rows and 24 variables and associated indicator matrix:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>BPXDAR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Diastolic blood pressure</p>
</dd>
<dt>RIAGENDR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Gender, 1 = male, 2 = female</p>
</dd>
<dt>RIDAGEYR</dt>
<dd>
<p>Age in years</p>
</dd>
<dt>BMXBMI</dt>
<dd>
<p>Body mass index</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The dataset is combined from the NHANES release cycles 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004. Almost
all PCB have both the missing and censored values as falling below the limits of detection (LODs). The dataset include
two components, the first component is the observed NHANES data where the censored PCB measurements are replaced
by the LODs dividing the square root of 2. The second component is a data frame including the censoring indicators
of the data, in that data frame, 0 indicates an observed PCB measurement, 1 indicates a censored PCB measurement, and 'NA' indicates
a missing PCB measurement.

<p>The subset provided here was selected to demonstrate the functionality of the mvnimpute package,
no clinical conclusions should be derived from it.
