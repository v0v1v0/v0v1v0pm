<h2>
Multivariate Normal and t Distributions
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes multivariate normal and t probabilities, quantiles, random deviates, 
  and densities. Log-likelihoods for multivariate Gaussian models and Gaussian copulae 
  parameterised by Cholesky factors of covariance or precision matrices are implemented 
  for interval-censored and exact data, or a mix thereof. Score functions for these 
  log-likelihoods are available. A class representing multiple lower triangular matrices 
  and corresponding methods are part of this package.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Package <span class="pkg">mvtnorm</span> provides functionality for dealing with multivariate
normal and t-distributions. The package interfaces FORTRAN and
<code>C</code> code for evaluating multivariate normal probabilities written by
Alan Genz and Tetsuhisa Miwa. Functions <code>pmvnorm</code>,
<code>pmvt</code>, <code>qmvnorm</code>, and <code>qmvt</code> return
normal and t probabilities or corresponding quantiles computed by these
original implementations. Users interested in the computation of such
probabilities or quantiles, for example for multiple testing purposes,
should use this functionality.
</p>
<p>When the multivariate normal log-likelihood function, defined by the
log-probability in the discrete or interval-censored case or by the
log-density for exact real observations, or a mix thereof, shall be
computed, functions <code>lpmvnorm</code>, <code>ldmvnorm</code>, and
<code>ldpmvnorm</code> are better suited.  They rely on an independent
implementation of Genz' algorithm (for log-probabilities), can be customised
(different quasi-Monte Carlo schemes), and are a bit faster.  Most
importantly, the corresponding score functions are available through
functions <code>slpmvnorm</code>, <code>sldmvnorm</code>, or
<code>sldpmvnorm</code>, which help to speed-up parameter estimation
considerably. Users interested in this functionality should
consult the <code>lmvnorm_src</code> package vignette.
